If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nYes, upgrading the consensus mechanism of VeChainThor from Proof of Authority (PoA) to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). See the provided VIPs for details of the changes. \n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs and/or what attack vectors are you most concerned about?**\n\nThe change in the consensus mechanism and the distribution of rewards\n\n**What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported?**\n\nAll of the above listed standards are implemented on chain but do not form part of the upgrade.\n\n**What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?**\n\nThe fact that two traditional audits are taking place in parallel with this Attackathon.\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nThere is the executor address and stargate address which have privileged roles in the network and their actions so long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them are expected.\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nBoth the executor and stargate address are essentially out of scope as they are known addresses and operated by trusted third parties.\n\n**Which chains and/or networks is and will the code in scope be deployed to?**\n\nVeChainThor\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nThere are no new dependencies. All of the old dependencies are out of scope. \n\n**What are the most valuable educational resources already available? (Ie. Documentation, Explainer videos or articles, etc)**\n\nFor more information about the VeChain Hayabusa upgrade refer to, please visit the following resources:\n- https://docs.vechain.org/ \n- VeChainThor Hayabusa Upgrade Release Branch\n    - https://github.com/vechain/thor/tree/release/hayabusa \n- VeChain Hayabusa E2E Tests Repo\n    - https://github.com/vechain/hayabusa-e2e \n- VeChain Hayabusa Upgrade VIPs\n    - https://github.com/vechain/VIPs/blob/master/vips/VIP-253.md\n    - https://github.com/vechain/VIPs/blob/master/vips/VIP-254.md",
