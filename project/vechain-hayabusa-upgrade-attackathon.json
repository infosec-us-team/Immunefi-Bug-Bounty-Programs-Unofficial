Here's how they work:\n\n**Before the Attackathon**<br/> Immunefi works with the project to host a security-focused education period, providing top tier education and support to security researchers.\n\n**During the Attackathon**<br/> Security researchers experience optimal hunting conditions, with direct project support, responsiveness, and duplicate rewards.\n\n**After the Attackathon**<br/> Immunefi spotlights the security accomplishments with a custom leaderboard, Attackathon Summary Report, Bugfix Reviews, and Individual Achievement Cards.\n\nUltimately, Attackathons serve to secure projects, develop their security ecosystem, and create new opportunities for security researchers."

So if projects make more bug fixes mid-competition then the size of the mitigation competition reward pool increases up to the maximum.\n\nThe full mitigation competition reward terms can be [read here](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/33256328266769-Mainnet-Audit-Competition-Rules).\n\n__Code Updates Log__\nTBD",

If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nYes, upgrading the consensus mechanism of VeChainThor from Proof of Authority (PoA) to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).

The Hayabusa upgrade will\nupgrade VeChainThor’s consensus mechanism, tokenomics and degree of decentralization.​\n​\nKey Highlights:​\n- **Upgrade to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: VeChainThor will migrate from PoA to DPoS, a more\ndecentralized consensus mechanism, while maintaining strong security and performance.​\n- **Enhanced VTHO Tokenomics**: A dynamic VTHO generation rate will be distributed as a block reward to\nvalidators and delegators that contribute to securing the VeChainThor network.​",

      "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
