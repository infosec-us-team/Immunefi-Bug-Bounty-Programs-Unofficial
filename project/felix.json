      "programOverview": "Felix is collateralized debt position protocol running on Hyperliquid L1. Our goal is to let anyone unlock liquidity or earn yield in a secure, risk‑adjusted, and friction‑free way.\n\nThe feUSD CDP Market is a money market that brings together feUSD borrowers / minters and Stability Pool depositors. It uses the Liquity v2 architecture\n\nFor more information about Felix Protocol, please visit https://usefelix.xyz/.\n\nFelix Protocol provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n>\n>\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nFelix Protocol adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n    Smart Contract  —  Critical\n    Smart Contract  —  High\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see Best Practices: Primacy of Impact \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- ETH_GAS_COMPENSATION set to 0. Due to the nature of the HyperEVM chain, this gas compensation is not required to still keep liquidations incentivised also considering that the COLL_GAS_COMPENSATION is not capped at 2 ether anymore.\n- Currently we are not including LST tokens therefore the fetchRedemption price mechanism has been excluded by the code. In case we’ll include LSTs we will proceed with reintegrating this price logic.\n\nThe list below includes the issues arisen from Liquity V2 audits. The ones closed as accepted can be considered accepted by us as well. For what concerns the Cantina competition audit, it is assumed that we acknowledge all the findings.\n\n- Dedaub - [Core Protocol Audit Report I](https://dedaub.com/audits/liquity/liquity-v2-aug-28-2024/), August 2024\n- Dedaub - [Core Protocol Audit Report II](https://dedaub.com/audits/liquity/liquity-v2-second-audit-nov-11-2024/), November 2024\n- Coinspect - [Bold Core Smart Contract Audit](https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Liquity%20-%20Bold%20-%20v241231.pdf), December 2024\n- Recon - [Liquity Security Review](https://github.com/GalloDaSballo/bold-review), October 2024\n- [Cantina Competition](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/fca4f98a-7d24-49f1-9a3b-80e5e65b2b30), March-April 2025\n\nThe list below includes the security assessments performed directly on Felix itself.

Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "_blank_",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. \nReward Calculation for Critical Level Reports\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 20 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n\n- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward.\n\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 4 000 to USD 10 000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Felix Protocol team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
