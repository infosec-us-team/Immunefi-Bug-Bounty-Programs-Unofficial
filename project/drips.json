      "programOverview": "Drips is an Ethereum protocol and web app that makes it easy for organizations and individuals to provide direct financial support to developers of free and open source software (FOSS).\n\nIn essence, Drips serves as an off-the-shelf solution for direct and recurring financial support, allowing organizations to effortlessly allocate ongoing ERC-20 tokens to the projects they consider essential and to link their success to the success of their dependents.\n\nIn Drips, funders provide financial support to FOSS developers by creating Drip Lists.  A Drip List is a collection of Ethereum addresses, ENS names and Git repositories curated by an individual user or organization and packaged together under one title. This list is accompanied by a percentage of funds to be allocated to each item on the list. These lists are publicly available, shareable on the web and open for anyone to fund.\n\nDrips also includes a built-in capability to allow funders to provide continuous, recurring support to FOSS projects over time, which we refer to as “streaming”. Funders who create a stream have the ability to cancel the remainder of a stream at any time and reclaim any un-streamed funds, providing them with complete control and the freedom to adapt their support based on evolving circumstances.\n\nFinally, to enable funders to support FOSS projects that do not have Ethereum addresses at the time the funds are sent, Drips also includes an optional, oracle-based identity solution, powered by Chainlink. This feature enables users to directly send funds to the owners of public software repositories on Github, which the owner of the repository can claim at a later time by adding a FUNDING.json file to the root of the repository’s default branch.\n\nFor more information about Drips, please visit [https://www.drips.network/ ](https://www.drips.network/) \n\nDrips provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nDrips adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical, or an impact resulting in a theft of funds that does not fall under this definition, would be rewarded 50 000.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- [https://hackmd.io/6_EgTHw6TVGlfxls0iKMAQ?view](https://hackmd.io/6_EgTHw6TVGlfxls0iKMAQ?view)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nDrips has provided these completed audit review reports for reference.

However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nFor smart contract-related vulnerabilities, in order to be eligible for a reward, the vulnerability must exist both in the deployed smart contract on Ethereum Mainnet and the GitHub file in the Assets in Scope table.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Drips team directly and are denominated in USD.
