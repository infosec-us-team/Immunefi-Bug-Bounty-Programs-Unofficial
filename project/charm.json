It uses Charm’s expertise in Decentralized Market Making Strategies to help anyone increase the liquidity of any Uniswap V3 pool. Using the vault, anyone can launch liquidity mining campaigns just like Uniswap V2, have full control over the vault’s strategy, increase token liquidity using concentrated liquidity, guarantee tokens will always be tradable, and achieve full decentralization. In addition, the vault’s shares are tokenized and ERC-20 compliant, which means LPs can deposit, withdraw, earn yield, and stake just like regular tokens.\n\nThe core contracts of Alpha Vaults version 2 are included within the scope of this bug bounty program.  \n",
