      "programOverview": "Balanced is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) consisting of a \ndecentralized balance sheet of ICX collateral, with the vision of creating \na vibrant ecosystem of tokens pegged to the value of real-world assets. It \nallows users to mint, borrow, and retire pegged assets, while also providing \nmarket makers with clearly defined arbitrage opportunities. The initial \niteration of Balanced will support the minting and retiring of USD-pegged \nassets referred to as Balance Dollars (bnUSD). \n\nFor further information about Balanced, you can check their white paper \nhere: <Link href=\"https://docs.balanced.network/technical/white-paper\">https://docs.balanced.network/technical/white-paper</Link>.\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around their smart contracts and is mostly \nconcerned with the loss of user funds and the shutdown of the contracts. ",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the\nfollowing types:\n\n**Smart Contracts/Blockchain:**\n\n- Re-entrancy\n- Logic errors\n  - including user authentication errors\n- Solidity/EVM details not considered\n  - including integer over-/under-flow\n  - including unhandled exceptions\n- Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - including composability vulnerabilities\n- Oracle failure/manipulation\n- Novel governance attacks\n- Economic/financial attacks\n  - including flash loan attacks\n- Congestion and scalability\n  - including running out of gas\n  - including block stuffing\n  - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n- Consensus failures\n- Cryptography problems\n  - Signature malleability\n  - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n  - Weak randomness\n  - Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on\nthe <Link href=\"/severity-system/\">Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System</Link>. This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nIn addition to the Immunefi Severity Classification System, the Balanced Bug \nBounty Program considers any vulnerability resulting in the cessation of \nfunctionality of a smart contract to be of **high** severity. In the event of \nconflict between this rule and the Immunefi Severity Classification System, \nthis rule will prevail.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily focusing on the funds at risk, though consideration for branding and PR may also be applied, only at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000.__\n\nPayouts are handled by the **Balanced** team directly and are denominated in USD. \nHowever, payouts are done in **ICX**. In the event of multiple submissions of the same vulnerability, the first complete bug report is the only one that shall receive a reward.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "**The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug\nbounty program:**\n\n- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n  - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity\n- Best practice critiques\n- Sybil attacks\n\n**The following activities are prohibited by bug bounty program:**\n\n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",
