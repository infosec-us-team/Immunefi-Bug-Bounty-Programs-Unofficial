  "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",

  "customOutOfScopeInformation": " - Best practice critiques\n- Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g. open doors, tailgating)\n- UI bugs and spelling mistakes on this or any associated website\n- Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks focused on overwhelming the network or individual nodes via excessive traffic, intentionally degrading service quality.\n- Resource exhaustion attacks such as attempts to exhaust system resources (CPU, memory, etc.) that do not meet criteria for accidental node instability. Issues that can be mitigated by operating a robust production system. (e.g., firewall in place, additional reources, optimized configs etc.)\n\n\nIf a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or proprietary information.\n\n*An embargo period is a fixed period of time from when a bug is reported to when a bug reporter can publicly disclose it. Bug reporters must not publicly discuss or disclose the presence or details of a bug during the embargo period. Once the embargo period is over bug reporters will be free to publicly discuss and disclose the details of the bug they’ve found and any proof-of-concept exploits that they may have written to validate the bug, with the exception of reports related to resource exhaustion attacks.\n\n__Other Notes__\n\nPlease note, we do not want to receive any sensitive data during any disclosure, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or any data associated with private/public keys.\n\n__Bitcoin SV Security Team PGP Key__\n\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: SKS 1.1.6\n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\n7auhB+wyIkulnJbt\n=zYLL\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----",
