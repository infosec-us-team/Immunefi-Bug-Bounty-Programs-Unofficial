Unlike other Bitcoin projects, only Bitcoin SV has the plan for a stable protocol and plan for massive on-chain scaling to become the world’s new money and the global public blockchain for enterprise.\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around the code base for BSV and spans end-to-end, ranging from the soundness of protocols (blockchain consensus model, the wire and p2p protocols, proof of work, etc.), protocol implementation, and compliance to network security and consensus integrity.",

This proof of concept should be code.\n\nPayouts are handled by the [Bitcoin Association for BSV](https://bitcoinassociation.net) directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __BSV__.",

Bug reporters must not publicly discuss or disclose the presence or details of a bug during the embargo period. Once the embargo period is over bug reporters will be free to publicly discuss and disclose the details of the bug they’ve found and any proof-of-concept exploits that they may have written to validate the bug, with the exception of reports related to resource exhaustion attacks.\n\n__Other Notes__\n\nPlease note, we do not want to receive any sensitive data during any disclosure, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or any data associated with private/public keys.\n\n__Bitcoin SV Security Team PGP Key__\n\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: SKS 1.1.6\n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\n7auhB+wyIkulnJbt\n=zYLL\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----",
