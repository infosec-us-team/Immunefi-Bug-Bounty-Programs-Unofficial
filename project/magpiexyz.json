  "programOverview": "Magpie is a BNB Chain native yield boosting platform that maximizes governance benefits for veTokenomics based protocols. Incubated by Wombat Exchange, Magpie is focused on locking WOM tokens to own governance rights and boosted yield benefits as liquidity provider on Wombat. \n\nThe platform offers users the opportunity to deposit their Stablecoins, BNB and Liquid BNB in single-sided boosted pools to earn high APR % while it allows Wombat Exchange voters to cost-effectively acquire voting power and earn passive income at the same time through the MGP token.\n\nMagpie offers WOM holders the chance to earn high APR by converting their tokens into mWOM. mWOM refers to \"Magpie WOM\". mWOM can be staked on Magpie to earn boosted passive income.\n\nWhen users convert their WOM tokens, they get mWOM that allows them to earn high rewards while Magpie locks all the converted WOM as veWOM on Wombat Exchange. That's how Magpie accumulates veWOM. veWOM entitles Magpie to boosted WOM rewards and governance benefits on Wombat Exchange. That's why Magpie can offer users sustainable boosted passive income.\n\nFor more information about MagpieXYZ, please visit [https://www.magpiexyz.io/ ](https://www.magpiexyz.io/)",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the  [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll Critical Smart Contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.  In addition, all Critical severity bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nRewards for high smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 20% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ for High smart contract bug reports.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [https://docs.magpiexyz.io/security/audit-reports](https://docs.magpiexyz.io/security/audit-reports)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __MagpieXYZ__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
