      "programOverview": "Spectra is an EVM-centric protocol for interest rate derivatives with an easy-to-use flagship app.\n\nThe Spectra protocol is permissionless, meaning its services are entirely open for public use. Anyone can create new markets at will, swap yield derivatives, or become a liquidity provider.\n\n**Protocol Primitives**\nSpectra's Yield Token and Principal Token, minted on top of ERC-4626 interest-bearing tokens, are core protocol primitives. Spectra separates the right to principal from future yield via a process called yield tokenization. This process unlocks new financial possibilities beyond standalone interest-bearing tokens.\n\n**Core Use-Cases**\n- Permissionless Pool Creation\n- Fixed Rates\n- Yield TradingThese key use cases can be abstracted into other narratives, such as upfront yield, discounted tokens, fixed savings, or fixed lending activities. \n\n**Key Objectives**\n\n- Empowering DeFi with a permissionless protocol for interest rate derivatives\n- Delivering cutting-edge solutions that can be seamlessly incorporated, built upon, and utilized by builders and other platforms in the DeFi ecosystem.\n- Upholding decentralization as a fundamental value, promoting community-driven growth via a DAO while the core team diligently and sustainably progresses the protocol\n\nThis Audit Competition is running on mainnet. The following conditions apply:\n\n- Spectra team will freeze the codebase during the duration of the Audit Competition \n- Concurrently Immunefi has cloned and frozen the repositories for the duration of the Audit Competition\n- Duplicates are rewarded\n- Bugs that aren't disclosed in the private audit report are valid for rewards.\n- The project commits to keeping private all info related to bug findings until this program is over. This means the project will not leak info about any bug findings or planned bug fixes, including bug findings found independently by the project or from concurrent private audits.\n\nSpectra provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD on Ethereum.\n\nFor more information, please visit  about [Spectra Finance](https://www.spectra.finance/)",

For the full details read our [Standardized Competition Reward Terms](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/31657285001873-Standardized-Competition-Reward-Terms).\n\nA reward pool of $40,000 USD will be distributed among participants, if any valid bugs are found. \n\nIf not a single bug is found (Insights do not count as bugs) the reward pool is $15% of $40,000 USD rewards → $6,000\n\nDuplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward.\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/).\n\nRewards will be distributed all at once based on Immunefi’s distribution formula after the event has concluded and the final bug reports have been resolved.\n\n__Insight Rewards Payment Terms__\n\n*Insight Rewards*: Portion of the Rewards Pool\n\n*The \"Insight\" severity was introduced on Boost (Audit Competitions) & Attackathon programs to recognize contributions that extend beyond identifying immediate vulnerabilities. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment.

If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nThis audit covers the integration of Curve NG and Curve Stableswap NG pools into Spectra’s core protocol. Spectra is currently using Cryptoswap pools, and this audit concerns the migration to these two new sets of pools. All other Spectra features remain intact, including the implementation of the Principal Token and the Yield Token. Below is a high-level overview of the integration tasks:\nIntegration of Cryptoswap NG pools\n\n- The next generation of Curve pools on which Spectra is currently based.\n- Integration of a new type of pool: oracle-based Stableswap NG pools\n- Upgradeable rate oracles for Stableswap NG pools that reports the rate of the PT in underlying based on its initial price\n- Deployment of Spectra with Stableswap NG pools through a new factory\n- Registration of rate oracles in a new dedicated registry\n- Addition of previews and interaction execution with the new pools in the router\n\n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs?**\n\nThe main focus should be the StableSwap NG integration. correctness, robustness and resilience of the rate adjustment oracles for the Principal Token should be thoroughly examined.\nSecondly, the new commands of the router should be examined.\n\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nCurve smart contracts and Open Zeppelin libraries.\n\nStableswap-NG documentation at [(https://docs.curve.fi/stableswap-exchange/stableswap-ng/overview/)]\n\nOpen Zeppelin v5 at [(https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/)]\n\n\n**Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\nSecurity problems related to the implementation of Curve Finance pools and their internal oracle manipulations. Only Spectra’s rate oracle implementation and its influence on Stableswap’s pricing shall be considered in scope, besides Spectra’s core components. \n\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nAny address controlled by the Spectra DAO\n\n**Previous Audits**\n\nSpectra’s completed audit reports can be found at [](https://docs.spectra.finance/security/audits).

      "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
