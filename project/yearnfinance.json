      "programOverview": "Yearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides lending aggregation and yield generation on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders. Their products include: \n\n__Vaults__\nCapital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.\n\nFurther resources regarding Yearn Finance can be found on their website, [https://yearn.finance/](https://yearn.finance/) and [documentation](https://docs.yearn.finance/).  \n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n- Re-entrancy\n- Logic errors\n  - including user authentication errors\n- Solidity/EVM details not considered\n  - including integer over-/under-flow\n  - including unhandled exceptions\n- Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - including composability vulnerabilities\n- Oracle failure/manipulation\n- Novel governance attacks\n- Economic/financial attacks\n  - including flash loan attacks\n- Congestion and scalability\n  - including running out of gas\n  - including block stuffing\n  - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n- Consensus failures\n- Cryptography problems\n- Signature malleability\n- Susceptibility to replay attacks\n- Weak randomness\n- Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards for Smart Contract vulnerabilities are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nTo determine the final reward amount, the likelihood to have a meaningful impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds is considered. The final decision on the payout amount will be determined by the Yearn Finance team at its discretion.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Yearn Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts can be made in USDC, DAI, YFI, or their Yearn Vault counterparts.",
