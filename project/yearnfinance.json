The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders. Their products include: \n\n__Vaults__\nCapital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.\n\nFurther resources regarding Yearn Finance can be found on their website, [https://yearn.finance/](https://yearn.finance/) and [documentation](https://docs.yearn.finance/).  \n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nTo determine the final reward amount, the likelihood to have a meaningful impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds is considered. The final decision on the payout amount will be determined by the Yearn Finance team at its discretion.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Yearn Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

Please refer to the rewards section below for additional details.\n- Bugs must be reproducible in order for us to verify the vulnerability.\n- Rewards and the validity of bugs are determined by the Yearn security team and any payouts are made at their sole discretion.\n- Terms and conditions of the Bug Bounty program can be changed at any time at the discretion of Yearn.\n- Details of any valid bugs may be shared with complementary protocols utilized in the Yearn ecosystem in order to promote ecosystem cohesion and safety.\n\n__Bug Bounty FAQ__\n\nQ: Is there a time limit for the Bug Bounty program?\nA: No. The Bug Bounty program currently has no end date, but this can be changed at any time at the discretion of Yearn.\n\nQ: Can I submit bugs anonymously and still receive payment?\nA: Yes. If you wish to remain anonymous you can do so and still be eligible for rewards as long as they are for valid bugs. Rewards will be sent to the valid Ethereum address that you provide.\n\nQ: Can I donate my reward to charity?\nA: Yes.
