The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.

Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.\n\nFurther resources regarding Yearn Finance can be found on their website, [https://yearn.finance/](https://yearn.finance/) and [documentation](https://docs.yearn.finance/).  \n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.

Please refer to the rewards section below for additional details.\n- Bugs must be reproducible in order for us to verify the vulnerability.\n- Rewards and the validity of bugs are determined by the Yearn security team and any payouts are made at their sole discretion.\n- Terms and conditions of the Bug Bounty program can be changed at any time at the discretion of Yearn.\n- Details of any valid bugs may be shared with complementary protocols utilized in the Yearn ecosystem in order to promote ecosystem cohesion and safety.\n\n__Bug Bounty FAQ__\n\nQ: Is there a time limit for the Bug Bounty program?\nA: No. The Bug Bounty program currently has no end date, but this can be changed at any time at the discretion of Yearn.\n\nQ: Can I submit bugs anonymously and still receive payment?\nA: Yes. If you wish to remain anonymous you can do so and still be eligible for rewards as long as they are for valid bugs. Rewards will be sent to the valid Ethereum address that you provide.\n\nQ: Can I donate my reward to charity?\nA: Yes. You may donate your reward to a charity of your choosing, or to a gitcoin grant.",

Additionally, you may refer to https://yearn.watch and [https://yearn.watch/stats](https://yearn.watch/stats) for more information about each smart contract. \n\n__Submission Requirements__\n\nIn order to be considered for a reward, all bug reports must contain the following:\n\n- Description of suspected vulnerability\n- Steps to reproduce the issue\n- Your name and/or colleagues if you wish to be later recognized\n- (Optional) A patch and/or suggestions to resolve the vulnerability\n\n__Ethical Behavior Requirements__\n\nResponsible disclosure is predicated on ethical behavior. These guidelines outline best practices for the community as whole, whether you are reporting, or the recipient of a report. By stating that you adhere to this policy, you’re claiming to handle vulnerability information ethically, and abide by the following:\n\n- Do not attempt to leverage a vulnerability, or information of its existence, as part of a financial trading strategy or otherwise for financial gain.\n- Do not attempt to compromise systems upon which development of a product relies; including but not limited to compromising development systems, accounts, domains, email etc..\n- Do not attempt to sell vulnerability information or exploits.\n- Do not ask for any form of compensation from an affected party.\nYou may compensate a disclosing party if you would like to after all known vulnerability details have been disclosed.\n- Do not disclose a bug or vulnerability on mailing lists, public boards, forums, social media or any other channel prior to Responsibly Disclosing to the organizations you have a published relationship with\n- Do not attempt any illegal acts, including phishing, physical attacks, DDoS, or any attempt to gain access without authorization\n\n__3rd Party Affected Projects__\n\nIn the case where we become aware of security issues affecting other projects that has never affected Yearn, our intention is to inform those projects of security issues on a best effort basis.\n\nIn the case where we fix a security issue in Yearn that also affects the following neighboring projects, our intention is to engage in responsible disclosures with them as described in the adopted standard, subject to the deviations described in the deviations section below.\n\n__Deviations from the Standard__\n\nIn the case of a counterfeiting or fund-stealing bug affecting Yearn, however, we might decide not to include those details with our reports to partners ahead of coordinated release, as long as we are sure that they are not vulnerable.",
