      "programOverview": "Yearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides lending aggregation and yield generation on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders. Their products include: \n\n__Vaults__\nCapital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.\n\nFurther resources regarding Yearn Finance can be found on their website, [https://yearn.finance/](https://yearn.finance/).\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused on its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.\n\n\n__Bug Bounty FAQ__\n\nQ: Is there a time limit for the Bug Bounty program?\nA: No. The Bug Bounty program currently has no end date, but this can be changed at any time at the discretion of Yearn.\n\nQ: Can I submit bugs anonymously and still receive payment?\nA: Yes. If you wish to remain anonymous you can do so and still be eligible for rewards as long as they are for valid bugs. Rewards will be sent to the valid Ethereum address that you provide.\n\nQ: Can I donate my reward to charity?\nA: Yes. You may donate your reward to a charity of your choosing, or to a gitcoin grant.",

The final decision on the payout amount will be determined by the Yearn Finance team at its discretion.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Yearn Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
