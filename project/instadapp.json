      "programOverview": "The Instadapp platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools for both users and developers to harness the full potential of DeFi. With products ranging from refinancing and flashloan strategies to lending platforms and smart wallet protocols, Instadapp aims to optimize DeFi interactions.\n\nThis bug bounty program covers the following protocols and services:\n\nInstadapp PRO (DeFi Smart Accounts)\n\nInstadapp PRO is a comprehensive platform for managing and utilizing DeFI, users can access the top lending protocols and maximize their gains by leveraging and refinancing between protocols. Instadapp Pro allows users to execute advanced swaps and other complex transactions. \n\nAvocado Smart Wallet\n\nAvocado is a next generation Account Abstraction wallet created by the Instadapp Team. Avocado abstracts networks, gas and addresses making it easier to interact with the growing and complex web3 world. Avocado features a unified USDC gas tank, mass payments, cross chain transaction, transaction previews, built in DEX and Bridging services and 2FA security.\n\nFluid \n\nFluid works as a multi-layered protocol with a unified liquidity layer that enables many protocols to be built on top:\n\n- Fluid Liquidity Layer: The base liquidity protocol for Fluid, all liquidity and protocols draw their liquidity from the liquidity layer.\n- Fluid Lending Protocol: foundational component designed to facilitate secure and highly efficient lending. You can think of it as the 'Deposit and Earn' of Fluid.  \n- Fluid Vault Protocol: The first protocol built on top of the Liquidity Layer, the vault protocol enables users to supply assets and borrow against them in a single-asset/single-debt vault similar to MakerDAO.\n\n\nFor more information about Instadapp, please visit https://instadapp.io/. \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and dapp and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n- Deletion of user data\n- Theft of governance funds\n- Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n- Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract vulnerabilities, the reward is 10% of the directly affected funds, up to a maximum of USD 500,000. The calculation considers the funds at risk based on the bug report submission date and time. There is a minimum guaranteed reward of USD 25,000 to encourage reporting even for smaller valued critical bugs.\n\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high smart contract impacts, the reward is capped at $100,000 and is based on 50% of the value of the affected funds. The calculation considers the funds at risk based on the bug report submission date and time. There is a minimum guaranteed reward of USD 5,000 to encourage reporting even for smaller valued critical bugs.\n\n__Secondary/Market Attack on Fluid__\n\nFluid as a lending protocol utilizes different aspects of the blockchain which may indirectly affect the protocol. The following outline conditions for particular secondary attacks that are not directly on the Fluid contracts, but that have secondary or associated effects to the Fluid contracts may be considered for a reward:\n\n- The attack must directly impact Fluid i.e an attack which affects the broader market such as price manipulation but is not targeting Fluid would not qualify.\n\nExamples of secondary attacks would be:\n\n- Manipulation of a DEX or on Chain price oracle from a secondary source, which results in the immediate and total loss of funds of the Fluid protocol, where the attack is specifically targeting Fluid protocol.\n- Flash Loan based attack that would cause immediate and irreversible financial loss to Fluid protocol; where the attack is specifically targeting the Fluid protocol, this would exclude attacks which manipulate the price of a single token used on Fluid.\n\nPrior published audits are here for review, any noted vulnerability or bugs in previously completed audits are not eligible for a reward.\n\nDefi Smart Accounts (DSA)/Instadapp PRO\n- [Peckshield - Mar 16, 2021](https://github.com/Instadapp/dsa-contracts/blob/master/audits/v2_PeckShield_Mar_2021.pdf)\n- [Peckshield - Mar 18, 2020](https://github.com/Instadapp/dsa-contracts/blob/master/audits/v1_PeckShield_Mar_2020.pdf)\n- [Samczun Audit - Mar 2020](https://github.com/Instadapp/dsa-contracts/blob/master/audits/v1_samczsun_Mar_2020.md)\n\nAvocado\n- [Statemind - Sept 28, 2023](https://github.com/Instadapp/avocado-audits/blob/main/Statemind-Audit-Report-Avocado-v3.pdf)\n- [Peckshield - June 12, 2023](https://github.com/Instadapp/avocado-audits/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Avocado-v3.pdf)\n\nFluid\n- [Statemind - Dec 29th, 2023](https://github.com/statemindio/public-audits/blob/main/Instadapp/2023-12-29_Instadapp_Fluid.pdf)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n\nWhen calculating the USD value of total value locked (TVL) to determine funds at risk, outstanding borrows are excluded.\n\nTo be eligible for a reward, the vulnerability must exist in the deployed smart contract.\n\nBugs resulting in temporary freezing of funds are not eligible for a reward. \n\nPayouts are handled by the Instadapp team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in stablecoins like, USDC, USDT and DAI at the discretion of the team.",

      "feasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
