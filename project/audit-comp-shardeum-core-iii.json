      "assetsBodyV2": "__Asset Accuracy Assurance__\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n__Private Known Issues Reward Policy__\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward equal to that of a bug one severity lower.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nShardeum commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Shardeum will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nShardeum adheres to the Primacy of Rules for all impacts. Which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this audit competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Shardeum has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",
      "impactsBody": "**Which chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?**\n\nShardeum\n\n**Which parts of the code are you most concerned about?**\nWe are concerned with the web3 and business logic within all four repositories in this boost. Things like transaction queuing, penalties, and consensus. This includes any internal transactions or things involving the global account.\n\n**What attack vectors are you most concerned about?**\n\nParsing/signature errors, cheating the rotation system, and transaction processing. We received quite a few message parsing and signature related reports in the previous boosts and feel like there may still be some vulns to find. Secure accounts and multisig transactions involving them will be valuable targets and need extra scrutiny.\n**Which part(s) of the system do you want whitehats to attempt to break the most?**\ntransaction queuing, penalties, and consensus.\n**Are there any assumed invariants that you want whitehats to attempt to break?**\nSum of EOA account balances before attack == Sum of EOA account balances after attack + transaction fees. This should cover SHM disappearing from the network or being created out of thin air\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nThese are listed in package.json\n\n**Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\n\nA note on Shardeum and Shardus Core scope: the default config in release mode in the branch is in scope. Whitehats are free to configure, patch, and modify their own malicious nodes however they want. However, target nodes must be running the default config in the target branch in release mode. This is to prevent the whitehats from wasting time reporting things we specifically allow in debug mode. The only exception is minNodes and maxNodes settings, which allow different size networks to be created. Certain vulnerabilities may only exist in certain network sizes, and we do not wish to limit Whitehat activity and participation for lack of computing power attempting to run a large local network. However, network-wide attacks that only work under 128 nodes may be rejected or reduced in severity at our discretion. If the researchers can enable debug mode options remotely then that is valid and can be paid out.\n\nAttacks that require the network to still be initializing/bootstrapping are out of scope. Wait until the network mode reaches “processing” + 15 cycles after startup before launching attacks. The rules for staking/join are a little different and the network will not be public during this time. Attacks on a network that is repairing itself (was once in “processing” mode but has since degraded to “safety” or “recovery”) are in scope.\nThis bounty introduces the concept of a KYC-required “genesis node”. Attacks performed with genesis nodes are in scope, attacks performed against genesis nodes are in scope. Nodes attacking themselves are out of scope.\n\n0day vulnerabilities in dependencies are in scope. Any other vuln in dependencies is out of scope. Smart contracts are out of scope\n\nFinally, the more nodes that are required to launch an attack, the more at risk the vuln is of being downgraded. If it takes 33% (for example) of the nodes in the network being malicious to cause damage, then it becomes difficult to distinguish the impact from a brute-force/51% attack, which is completely out of scope.\n\n**Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?**\n\nPlease consider how your vulnerability will behave on a network with a shard size of 129 nodes. We will accept reports with a PoC on a smaller network, but the severity may be affected if the impact is less feasible on network with a shard size of 129 nodes.",

This will cover four components: Shardus Core Protocol, Shardeum Validator Nodes, networking libs, and Crypto-utils.

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
