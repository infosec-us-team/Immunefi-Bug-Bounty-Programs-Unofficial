      "programOverview": "Kadena was founded on the idea that blockchain could revolutionize how the world interacts and transacts. But to get to mass adoption, chain technology and the ecosystem connecting it to the business world needed to be reimagined from the ground up. Our founders built a proprietary chain architecture and created the tools to make blockchain work for business – at speed, scale, and energy efficiency previously thought unachievable.\n\nFor more information about Kadena, please visit [https://kadena.io/](https://kadena.io/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts, blockchain, and chainweaver and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Prolonged network shutdown\n  - Asset loss or theft\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC (Proof of Concept document) with an end result that impacts an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All Medium, High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. A valid PoC is demonstrated privately, for example using a private devnet, and must clearly communicate the nature of the flaw, how it was discovered, and how to exercise the flaw within that private environment. It must be sufficiently well documented to allow reproduction of the findings by a third party. Explanations and statements alone are not accepted as PoC: code is required. Any bug report that has already been run on a public facing network such as mainnet or testnet will not be eligible for payout.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Congestion and scalability vulnerabilities\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Kadena team__ directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __KDA and stablecoins__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team. In addition, as part of claiming a bug bounty, whitehats must complete a KYC process from SumSub and submit relevant tax documents requested by the Kadena team.",
