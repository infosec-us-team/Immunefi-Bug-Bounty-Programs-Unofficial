  "programOverview": "VeChain (VET) is a versatile enterprise-grade L1 smart contract platform.\n\nVeChain began in 2016  working with a host of enterprises to explore applications of blockchain. VeChain would begin their transition to public blockchain in 2017 with the ERC-20 token VEN, before launching a mainnet of their own in 2018 using the ticker VET.\n\nVeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to create an ecosystem which solves major data hurdles for multiple global industries from medical to energy, food & beverage to sustainability and SDG goals. By leveraging the power of trustless data, VeChain is building the digital backbone that will underpin the fourth industrial revolution, which demands real-time and trustless data sharing between many participants.\n\nFor more information about VeChain, please visit https://www.vechain.org/  \n\nVeChain provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \nPlease note that the VeChain team may take up to two business days to reply to bug submissions.",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability described in the Bug Bounty Report and determined by VeChain that could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward USD 100 000. However, a minimum reward of USD 35 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\n__For critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out to the legal name of Security Researcher submitting the Bug Bounty Report as follows:__\n\n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown) - USD 35 000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork) - USD 35 000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork) - USD 35 000\n\n__For high Blockchain/DLT impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows:__\n- Unintended chain split (network partition) - USD 20 000\n- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters - USD 15 000",

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
