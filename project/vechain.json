VeChain would begin their transition to public blockchain in 2017 with the ERC-20 token VEN, before launching a mainnet of their own in 2018 using the ticker VET.\n\nVeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to create an ecosystem which solves major data hurdles for multiple global industries from medical to energy, food & beverage to sustainability and SDG goals. By leveraging the power of trustless data, VeChain is building the digital backbone that will underpin the fourth industrial revolution, which demands real-time and trustless data sharing between many participants.\n\nFor more information about VeChain, please visit https://www.vechain.org/  \n\nVeChain provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \nPlease note that the VeChain team may take up to two business days to reply to bug submissions.",

However, a minimum reward of USD 35 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\n__For critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out to the legal name of Security Researcher submitting the Bug Bounty Report as follows:__\n\n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown) - USD 35 000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork) - USD 35 000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork) - USD 35 000\n\n__For high Blockchain/DLT impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows:__\n- Unintended chain split (network partition) - USD 20 000\n- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters - USD 15 000",
