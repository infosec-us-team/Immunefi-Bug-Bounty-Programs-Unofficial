      "programOverview": "Flux Finance is a decentralized lending protocol built by the Ondo Finance team.\n\nThe protocol is a fork of Compound V2 with additional functionality to support both permissionless (e.g. USDC) and permissioned (e.g. OUSG) tokens. Permissions are enforced on a per-asset basis. For example, a USDC lender won't have any restrictions, but a USDC borrower using OUSG as collateral will need to satisfy OUSG's permissions.\n\nSimilar to Compound, Flux enables overcollateralized lending and borrowing in a peer-to-pool (p2pool) model.\n\nFor more information about Flux Finance, please visit [https://fluxfinance.com/  ](https://fluxfinance.com/)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the[  Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Bug reports are required to include a runnable PoC in order to prove impact. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 25 000 for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nThe following known issues are also considered out of scope of this program:\n- Effects from blacklists (e.g. KYC revoked, USDC blacklist), if the effect only impacts the specific user.\n- Effects from using hypothetical use of tokens that do not follow the ERC-20 standard or include unusual behavior (e.g. transfer tax). If a token has certain functionality but that functionality is currently disabled, the effect will also be considered out of scope.\n- Misuse of admin rights (e.g. malicious admin multi-sig)\n- The protocol is forked from CompoundV2. The fToken contracts are forked from this [commit](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376). All other contracts (Comptroller, CErc20Delegator, InterestRateModel, etc.) are forked from this [commit](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/3affca87636eecd901eb43f81a4813186393905d). Bug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for the program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report. Previous audits of CompoundV2 can be found at: [https://docs.compound.finance/v2/security/#audits](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/security/#audits)\n- Any known issues in CompoundV2 up to these commits are considered out of scope. This includes, but is not limited to:\n   - First deposit bug when a market is initialized - example [video](https://youtu.be/_pO2jDgL0XE?t=157)\n   - Discrepancy in borrow rate per block on-chain vs. displayed APY in the UI\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Flux Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.  The payment will be made by Flux Finance (the entity).",

      "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
