Everything about Defly is designed to keep it this way, unlike most crypto exchanges.\n\nFor more information about Defly, please visit [https://defly.app/](https://defly.app/).\n\nThe Algorand Foundation’s sponsorship of this bug  bounty program will expire on 30.06.2024.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nReports of __Critical__ application bugs will be rewarded with a bounty of up to USD 100,000. We require the report demonstrates an exploit that could directly lead to a loss of funds greater than or equal to USD 50,000. The bounty amount is 10% of the total value of the affected wallets at the time the report is submitted. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 10,000 and the maximum is USD 100,000. \n\nThe Algorand Foundation has agreed to match 100% of any financial reward offered by Defly for any validated Critical or High impact vulnerability payout. The matching payout is already included in the reward amounts displayed on the program. For example, if a white hat finds a critical vulnerability and it is validated, they will be eligible to receive USD 50,000 from Defly as well as USD 50,000 from the Algorand Foundation for a total of USD 100,000.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the (‘Kudelski Security Audit’) are not eligible for a reward\n\n__KYC__ shall be completed for bug bounty hunters submitting a vulnerability report and requesting a reward for Critical and High Smart Contracts vulnerabilities and Critical Websites and Applications vulnerabilities. The basic information needed is full name, residential address, and passport details (DOB, issuing country and passport number). Based on the basic information submitted, Defly Wallet team may request further information at its sole discretion for compliance with applicable laws.\n\nAdditionally, all levels of bug bounty hunters submitting a vulnerability report and requesting a reward need to submit certification that (i) they are not acting, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of any person, group entity, or nation named by any Executive Order or the United States Treasury Department as a terrorist, “Specially Designated National and Blocked Person,” or other banned or blocked person, entity, nation, or transaction pursuant to any law, order, rule or regulation that is enforced or administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control; and (ii) they are not engaging in, instigating or facilitating this transaction, directly or indirectly, on behalf of any such person, group, entity, or nation. They also need to submit an attestation that all information provided is true, correct, up-to-date and not misleading. The collection of this information will be done by the __Defly Wallet__ team.\n\nBug bounty reward payouts (including all Matching Payments and top-ups, if any) are handled by the Defly Wallet team directly and are denominated in __USDCa__.
