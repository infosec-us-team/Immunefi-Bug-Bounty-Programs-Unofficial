      "programOverview": "Burrow is a decentralized, non-custodial pool-based interest rates platform that enables users to supply assets to earn interest, and to borrow against them to unlock liquidity. Burrow is similar in nature to Aave, Compound, and other pool-based protocols. Burrow runs natively on the NEAR blockchain, a layer 1, proof-of-stake, sharded blockchain with a WebAssembly runtime. The Burrow protocol's smart contracts are written in Rust.\n\nFor more information about Burrow, please visit [https://burrow.finance/](https://burrow.finance/) \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [ Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll Critical, High, and Medium bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, all bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 25 000 for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward for high vulnerabilities of __USD 5 000__.\n\nMedium smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward for medium vulnerabilities of __USD 1 000__.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope:\n- [https://docs.burrow.cash/product-docs/introduction/audits-and-risks](https://docs.burrow.cash/product-docs/introduction/audits-and-risks)\n\nBurrow requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. For individuals, the information needed is proof of address and government-issued photo ID for each authorized representative. For companies, the requirements will vary based on the type of the entity. \nPayouts are handled by the __Burrow__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ or __USDT__.\n",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:\n\n- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__\n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity\n- Best practice critiques\n- Sybil attacks\n- Centralization risks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n",
