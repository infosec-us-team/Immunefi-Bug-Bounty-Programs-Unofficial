Burrow is similar in nature to Aave, Compound, and other pool-based protocols. Burrow runs natively on the NEAR blockchain, a layer 1, proof-of-stake, sharded blockchain with a WebAssembly runtime. The Burrow protocol's smart contracts are written in Rust.\n\nFor more information about Burrow, please visit [https://burrow.finance/](https://burrow.finance/) \n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [ Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll Critical, High, and Medium bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, all bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 25 000 for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward for high vulnerabilities of __USD 5 000__.\n\nMedium smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward for medium vulnerabilities of __USD 1 000__.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope:\n- [https://docs.burrow.cash/product-docs/introduction/audits-and-risks](https://docs.burrow.cash/product-docs/introduction/audits-and-risks)\n\nBurrow requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. For individuals, the information needed is proof of address and government-issued photo ID for each authorized representative. For companies, the requirements will vary based on the type of the entity. \nPayouts are handled by the __Burrow__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ or __USDT__.\n",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
