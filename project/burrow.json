Burrow is similar in nature to Aave, Compound, and other pool-based protocols. Burrow runs natively on the NEAR blockchain, a layer 1, proof-of-stake, sharded blockchain with a WebAssembly runtime. The Burrow protocol's smart contracts are written in Rust.\n\nFor more information about Burrow, please visit [https://burrow.finance/](https://burrow.finance/)",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [ Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll Critical, High, and Medium bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, all bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 25 000 for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward for high vulnerabilities of __USD 5 000__.\n\nMedium smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward for medium vulnerabilities of __USD 1 000__.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope:\n- [https://docs.burrow.cash/product-docs/introduction/audits-and-risks](https://docs.burrow.cash/product-docs/introduction/audits-and-risks)\n\nBurrow requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. For individuals, the information needed is proof of address and government-issued photo ID for each authorized representative. For companies, the requirements will vary based on the type of the entity. \nPayouts are handled by the __Burrow__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
