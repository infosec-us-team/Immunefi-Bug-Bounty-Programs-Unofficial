      "programOverview": "Threshold USD is a decentralized protocol that enables you to borrow thUSD, a stablecoin soft-pegged against USD and backed by ETH and tBTC as collaterals with a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.\n\nOriginated as a modified fork of Liquity Protocol, Threshold USD was built to be self-sustained through a PCV (\"Protocol Controlled Value\"). There is no equivalent of LQTY token in Threshold USD. Instead all  revenues accrue into the PCV. Since there is no token, Bootstrapping is completed through an Initial Protocol Loan. \n\nThe result of the protocol owning its own liquidity (\"PCV\"), is a more predictable trajectory and a sustainable long-term product. The stability pool is funded by the PCV instead of user deposits, so no funds are wasted on rewards and those funds can instead be re-injected into the stability pool. As the protocol grows and accrues fees, the stability pool will be consistently topped up. \n\nFor more information about thUSD, please visit [https://app.thresholdusd.org/](https://app.thresholdusd.org/)\n\nthUSD bounties provide rewards in T. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nthUSD adheres to category 2: Notice Required. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Rules program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nThreshold USD has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n\n__Governance-Run Program__\n\nThis bug bounty program is governed by a governance proposal. To view the governance proposal poll, visit [https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-059-establish-a-bug-bounty-program-for-thusd/661](https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-059-establish-a-bug-bounty-program-for-thusd/661)",

This is a simplified 4-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- [https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev/issues](https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev/issues)\n- [https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev#known-issues](https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev#known-issues)\n- [https://github.com/liquity/dev/issues](https://github.com/liquity/dev/issues)\n- [https://github.com/backstop-protocol/dev/blob/409ece756492f97197101c8266fdc025021caff6/README.md#pricefeed-limitations-and-known-issues](https://github.com/backstop-protocol/dev/blob/409ece756492f97197101c8266fdc025021caff6/README.md#pricefeed-limitations-and-known-issues)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nthUSD has provided these completed audit review reports for reference.

Any impact that applies to assets not in active use, like test or mock files, are out-of-scope of the bug bounty program unless explicitly mentioned as in-scope.\n- All reports must be submitted in English.\n- Threshold USD would like to notify whitehats that payouts concerning high and critical reports may exceed the SLA established by Immunefi. These larger payouts could be delayed by a few hours or days, depending on the amount, to allow our governance process to fund the required payment, which can take up to 14 days. Threshold USD will inform the whitehat whenever this is the case, within the SLA timeframe, to manage expectations and provide clarity.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the thUSD team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in T ([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/threshold-network-token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/threshold-network-token)). \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between high and low for the day of the report submission as published on [CoinMarketCap.com](https://CoinMarketCap.com) Historical Data ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/threshold/historical-data/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/threshold/historical-data/)) for the T token. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price at the time of the bug report submission is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ and a max program cap of __USD 100 000__\n\nRewards for high smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 100% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ and a max cap of __USD 10 000__\n\nRewards for critical web/app bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ and a max cap of __USD 10 000__.\n\nRewards for high web/app bug reports will be further capped at 100% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited.
