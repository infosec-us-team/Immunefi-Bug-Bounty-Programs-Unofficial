      "programOverview": "Threshold USD (thUSD) is a stablecoin soft-pegged against USD and backed by ETH and tBTC as collaterals, with a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.\nWith either tBTC or ETH as your collateral, you'll be able to borrow USD at a competitive interest rate.\n\nThreshold USD is a modified fork of Liquity Protocol, built to be self-sustained through a PCV (\"Protocol Controlled Value\"). There is no equivalent of LQTY token in Threshold USD. Instead all  revenues accrue into the PCV. Since there is no token, Bootstrapping is completed through an Initial Protocol Loan. \n\nThe result of the protocol owning its own liquidity (\"PCV\"), is a more predictable trajectory and a sustainable long-term product. The stability pool is funded by the PCV instead of user deposits, so no funds are wasted on rewards and those funds can instead be re-injected into the stability pool. As the protocol grows and accrues fees, the stability pool will be consistently topped up. \n\nFor more information about thUSD, please visit [https://app.thresholdusd.org/](https://app.thresholdusd.org/)\n\nthUSD bounties provide rewards in T. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nthUSD adheres to category 2: Notice Required. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nthUSD adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Permanent freezing of funds\n- Smart Contract - High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n- Web/App - Critical - Taking state-modifying authenticated actions (with or without blockchain state interaction) on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user\n- Web/App - Critical - Direct theft of user funds\n- Web/App - Critical - Malicious interactions with an already-connected wallet\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nthUSD commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that thUSD will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nThreshold USD has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n\n__Governance-Run Program__\n\nThis bug bounty program is governed by a governance proposal. To view the governance proposal poll, visit [https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-059-establish-a-bug-bounty-program-for-thusd/661](https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-059-establish-a-bug-bounty-program-for-thusd/661)\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System v2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). This is a simplified 4-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- [https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev/issues](https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev/issues)\n- [https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev#known-issues](https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev#known-issues)\n- [https://github.com/liquity/dev/issues](https://github.com/liquity/dev/issues)\n- [https://github.com/backstop-protocol/dev/blob/409ece756492f97197101c8266fdc025021caff6/README.md#pricefeed-limitations-and-known-issues](https://github.com/backstop-protocol/dev/blob/409ece756492f97197101c8266fdc025021caff6/README.md#pricefeed-limitations-and-known-issues)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nthUSD has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [Spearbit Audit Report](https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/thUSD-Audit-Reports-f2ef9a35aa3142fe95a973c8f647faf0?pvs=4#b731738dfb064e4cb610aa3290448bb9)\n- [Mixbytes for BAMM Contract Audit Report](https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/thUSD-Audit-Reports-f2ef9a35aa3142fe95a973c8f647faf0?pvs=4#161ac08976a3405db14092c773476ea)\n- [Mixbytes Audit Report - General ](https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/thUSD-Audit-Reports-f2ef9a35aa3142fe95a973c8f647faf0?pvs=4#4e59a78ce65a47568cc27d2d1574bee3)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Smart Contract - Low\n- Web/App - Critical\n- Web/App - High\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a complete PoC, when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\n- Impacts only apply to assets in active use by the project, like contracts on mainnet or web/app assets used in production. Any impact that applies to assets not in active use, like test or mock files, are out-of-scope of the bug bounty program unless explicitly mentioned as in-scope.\n- All reports must be submitted in English.\n- Threshold USD would like to notify whitehats that payouts concerning high and critical reports may exceed the SLA established by Immunefi. These larger payouts could be delayed by a few hours or days, depending on the amount, to allow our governance process to fund the required payment, which can take up to 14 days. Threshold USD will inform the whitehat whenever this is the case, within the SLA timeframe, to manage expectations and provide clarity.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the thUSD team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in T ([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/threshold-network-token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/threshold-network-token)). \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ and a max program cap of __USD 100 000__\n\nRewards for high smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 100% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ and a max cap of __USD 10 000__\n\nRewards for critical web/app bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ and a max cap of __USD 10 000__.\n\nRewards for high web/app bug reports will be further capped at 100% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited.
