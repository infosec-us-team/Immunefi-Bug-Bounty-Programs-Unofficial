      "programOverview": "Threshold USD (thUSD) is a stablecoin soft-pegged against USD and backed by ETH and tBTC as collaterals, with a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.\nWith either tBTC or ETH as your collateral, you'll be able to borrow USD at a competitive interest rate.\n\nThreshold USD is a modified fork of Liquity Protocol, built to be self-sustained through a PCV (\"Protocol Controlled Value\"). There is no equivalent of LQTY token in Threshold USD. Instead all profits accrue into the PCV. Since there is no token, Bootstrapping is completed through an Initial Protocol Loan. \n\nThe result of the protocol owning its own liquidity (\"PCV\"), is a more predictable trajectory and a sustainable long-term product. The stability pool is funded by the PCV instead of user deposits, so no funds are wasted on rewards and those funds can instead be re-injected into the stability pool. As the protocol grows and accrues fees, the stability pool will be consistently topped up. \n\nFor more information about thUSD, please visit [https://app.thresholdusd.org/](https://app.thresholdusd.org/)\n\nthUSD bounties provide rewards in T. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nthUSD adheres to category 2: Notice Required. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nthUSD adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Permanent freezing of funds\n- Smart Contract - High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n- Web/App - Critical - Taking state-modifying authenticated actions (with or without blockchain state interaction) on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user\n- Web/App - Critical - Direct theft of user funds\n- Web/App - Critical - Malicious interactions with an already-connected wallet\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nthUSD commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that thUSD will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nThreshold USD has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n\n__Governance-Run Program__\n\nThis bug bounty program is governed by a governance proposal. To view the governance proposal poll, visit [https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-059-establish-a-bug-bounty-program-for-thusd/661](https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-059-establish-a-bug-bounty-program-for-thusd/661)\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- [https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev/issues](https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev/issues)\n- [https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev#known-issues](https://github.com/Threshold-USD/dev#known-issues)\n- [https://github.com/liquity/dev/issues](https://github.com/liquity/dev/issues)\n- [https://github.com/backstop-protocol/dev/blob/409ece756492f97197101c8266fdc025021caff6/README.md#pricefeed-limitations-and-known-issues](https://github.com/backstop-protocol/dev/blob/409ece756492f97197101c8266fdc025021caff6/README.md#pricefeed-limitations-and-known-issues)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nthUSD has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [Spearbit Audit Report](https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/thUSD-Audit-Reports-f2ef9a35aa3142fe95a973c8f647faf0?pvs=4#b731738dfb064e4cb610aa3290448bb9)\n- [Mixbytes for BAMM Contract Audit Report](https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/thUSD-Audit-Reports-f2ef9a35aa3142fe95a973c8f647faf0?pvs=4#161ac08976a3405db14092c773476ea)\n- [Mixbytes Audit Report - General ](https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/thUSD-Audit-Reports-f2ef9a35aa3142fe95a973c8f647faf0?pvs=4#4e59a78ce65a47568cc27d2d1574bee3)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Smart Contract - Low\n- Web/App - Critical\n- Web/App - High\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a complete PoC, when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\n- Impacts only apply to assets in active use by the project, like contracts on mainnet or web/app assets used in production. Any impact that applies to assets not in active use, like test or mock files, are out-of-scope of the bug bounty program unless explicitly mentioned as in-scope.\n- All reports must be submitted in English.\n- Threshold USD would like to notify whitehats that payouts concerning high and critical reports may exceed the SLA established by Immunefi. These larger payouts could be delayed by a few hours or days, depending on the amount, to allow our governance process to fund the required payment, which can take up to 14 days. Threshold USD will inform the whitehat whenever this is the case, within the SLA timeframe, to manage expectations and provide clarity.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the thUSD team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in T ([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/threshold-network-token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/threshold-network-token)). \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "These impacts are out of scope for this bug bounty program. \n\n__All Categories__\n\n- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist) except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code\n- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Feature requests\n- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain/DLT__ \n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity impacts\n- Impacts from Sybil attacks\n- Impacts involving centralization risks\n- Best practice recommendations\n\n__Web/App__ \n\n- Theoretical impacts without any proof or demonstration\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring physical access to the victim device\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring access to the local network of the victim\n- Reflected plain text injection (e.g. url parameters, path, etc.)\n   - This does not exclude reflected HTML injection with or without JavaScript\n   - This does not exclude persistent plain text injection\n- Any impacts involving self-XSS\n- Captcha bypass using OCR without impact demonstration\n- CSRF with no state modifying security impact (e.g. logout CSRF)\n- Impacts related to missing HTTP Security Headers (such as X-FRAME-OPTIONS) or cookie security flags (such as “httponly”) without demonstration of impact\n- Server-side non-confidential information disclosure, such as IPs, server names, and most stack traces\n- Impacts causing only the enumeration or confirmation of the existence of users or tenants\n- Impacts caused by vulnerabilities requiring un-prompted, in-app user actions that are not part of the normal app workflows\n- Lack of SSL/TLS best practices\n- Impacts that only require DDoS\n- UX and UI impacts that do not materially disrupt use of the platform\n- Impacts primarily caused by browser/plugin defects\n- Leakage of non sensitive API keys (e.g. Etherscan, Infura, Alchemy, etc.)\n- Any vulnerability exploit requiring browser bugs for exploitation (e.g. CSP bypass) \n- SPF/DMARC misconfigured records\n- Missing HTTP Headers without demonstrated impact\n- Automated scanner reports without demonstrated impact\n- UI/UX best practice recommendations\n- Non-future-proof NFT rendering\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n- Any testing on mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on local-forks of either public testnet or mainnet\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third-party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third-party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks that are executed against project assets\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n",
