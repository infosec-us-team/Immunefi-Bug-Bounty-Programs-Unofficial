      "description": "Yeet is a gamified DeFi protocol on Berachain that offers an interactive financial experience through strategy and timing. Its core feature, the Yeet Game, allows users to deposit BERA tokens into a pool, with the last depositor winning most of the funds. YeetBonds help protocols manage their liquidity efficiently, while Yeetard NFTs provide additional in-game benefits. \n\nThe native $YEET token can be farmed and staked for rewards. By integrating game mechanics into DeFi, Yeet fosters community engagement, liquidity solutions, and a unique way to participate in decentralized finance.  Learn more at https://www.yeetit.xyz/",

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
