When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action.\n\nFor more information about Forta, please visit [https://forta.org](https://forta.org).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All Blockchain/DLT and Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nAll rewards for the Forta bug bounty program are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place. Rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Frontrunning protection for Agent (Bot) registrations are disabled\n\nThe rewards for the Forta Network section, labeled as Blockchain/DLT in this bug bounty program, are only for the Forta Network assets.\n\nForta requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is a copy of ID with name/address and country of residence. The collection of this information will be done by the Forta team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Forta__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __FORT__.",
