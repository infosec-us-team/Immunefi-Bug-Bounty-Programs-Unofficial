      "programOverview": "[Popcorn](https://popcorn.network/) is a new paradigm for DeFi where yield-generating products simultaneously fund social impact beneficiaries at no additional cost to the user. These beneficiaries are nonprofits, charities, and grassroot projects working in the areas of environment, education, open source, and inequality. Members of the PopcornDAO (POP token holders) are eligible to participate in all aspects of DAO governance, including beneficiary nominations and grant elections. They determine which beneficiaries receive a percentage of earned protocol fees on a recurring basis, and are incentivized to do so with POP rewards.\n\nAlong with directly funding community-selected beneficiaries, one of Popcorn’s key goals is to be a bridge between the social impact world and DeFi, helping them onramp into DeFi and educating them about the opportunities of DeFi and web3 to achieve social impact goals through community-led and equitable means. Popcorn will introduce them not only to DeFi but all the benefits of decentralization. In summary, Popcorn’s purpose is to aid the current revolutionary shift in global systems through accessible DeFi products that align financial wellbeing with positive global impact.\n\nFor more information about Popcorn Network, please visit [https://popcorn.network/](https://popcorn.network/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Temporary freezing of funds\n  - Unable to call contract\n  - Gas drainage / freezing of funds caused by gas overflow\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns",
