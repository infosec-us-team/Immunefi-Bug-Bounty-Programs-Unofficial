  "programOverview": "USX is a fully collateralized neodollar developed by Scroll, designed to merge the best of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to deliver stable, sustainable rewards. Unlike conventional stablecoins, USX introduces a new paradigm — it is private, gasless, and spendable in real life. This is made possible through Cloak, Scroll’s privacy layer, along with chain- level customizations and integrated payment partners.\n\nFor more information about USX, please visit https://www.usx.capital/.\n\nUSX provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nUSX will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nUSX adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\nSmart Contract  —  Critical\nSmart Contract  —  High\nSmart Contract  —  Medium\nWebsite & Application  —  Critical\nWebsite & Application  —  High\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.",

  "rewardsBody": "__Rewards by Threat Level__\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $100,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000  is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\nFor critical web/apps bugs, reports will be rewarded a flat amount of $5,000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. \n- The amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at 100% and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every [1800 blocks] the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down.\n\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of $5,000 to $10,000 with the reward calculated based on 100% of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward.\n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward.\n\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the USX team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
