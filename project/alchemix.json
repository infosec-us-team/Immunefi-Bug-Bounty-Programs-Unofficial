      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All Medium, High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. All Low Smart Contract bug reports require a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at __10%__ of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 35 000__ and a maximum of __USD 300 000__. For High vulnerability reports, the payouts will be primarily calculated as 10% of potential economic damage, primarily taking into account funds at risk but also PR and branding aspects, and bounded by the payout range for the vulnerability level. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - All vulnerabilities listed here [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue++-label%3A%22G+%28Gas+Optimization%29%22+-label%3A%22QA+%28Quality+Assurance%29%22 ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue++-label%3A%22G+%28Gas+Optimization%29%22+-label%3A%22QA+%28Quality+Assurance%29%22)(succinct) \n  - All vulnerabilities listed here [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+) (full)\n  - All vulnerabilities listed in [Runtime Verification audit](https://github.com/runtimeverification/publications/blob/main/reports/smart-contracts/Alchemix_v2.pdf)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Alchemix__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
