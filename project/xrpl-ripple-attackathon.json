Here's how they work:\n\n**Before the Attackathon**<br/> Immunefi works with the project to host a security-focused education period, providing top tier education and support to security researchers.\n\n**During the Attackathon**<br/> Security researchers experience optimal hunting conditions, with direct project support, responsiveness, and duplicate rewards.\n\n**After the Attackathon**<br/> Immunefi spotlights the security accomplishments with a custom leaderboard, Attackathon Summary Report, Bugfix Reviews, and Individual Achievement Cards.\n\nUltimately, Attackathons serve to secure projects, develop their security ecosystem, and create new opportunities for security researchers."

That means that even if 1 Low severity bug is found, the whole reward pool is unlocked and will be fully distributed between security researchers. \n\nIf not a single bug is found (Insights do not count as bugs) the reward pool is $30,000 USD. \n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid and unlock the corresponding reward pool.\n\nCode of the assets in scope is frozen while the program is live.\n\nDuplicate submissions of bugs are valid. Duplicate submissions of Insights are invalid.\n\nThe project commits to keeping private all info related to bug findings until this program is over. This means the project will not leak info about any bug findings or planned bug fixes, including bug findings found independently by the project or from concurrent private audits.\n\n__Insight Rewards Payment Terms__\n\n*Insight Rewards*: Portion of the Rewards Pool\n\nThe \"Insight\" severity was introduced on Audit Competitions & Attackathon programs to recognize contributions that extend beyond identifying immediate vulnerabilities. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment.

The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers are required to submit KYC within 14 days of KYC being requested, else their rewards may be forfeited. Immunefi may make exceptions due to extenuating circumstances.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\n- Whitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n   - Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\n- Immunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this Audit Competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\n- When there is uncertainty about how feasible an attack is Immunefi will use our feasibility limitation standards to determine the severity of the report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\n- By adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Ripple/ XRPL has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\n- No upgrade. SAV and Lending protocol are V1\n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs and/or what attack vectors are you most concerned about?**\n\nPrioritize anything that has to do with the security of the funds. The security of funds can be compromised through the following vectors: \n\n*Lending Protocol:*\n- Liquidation Logic: Find ways to trigger unfair liquidations or prevent liquidations from happening\n- Interest Rate Calculation: Discover bugs that lead to incorrect interest accrual, either for the lender or borrower\n- Clawback and Deepfreeze: test if asset freezing and clawback can be circumvented in lending protocol\n- Administrative attacks: Mess with the protocol's records and internal numbers to break its rules, causing a mismatch between funds and shares.\n\n*SAV:*\n- Share Redemption/Minting: Exploit the mechanism for issuing or redeeming MPT tokens to unfairly gain or drain assets\n- Deposit/Withdrawal Logic: Uncover edge cases that allow a user to withdraw more assets than they deposited or are entitled to\n- Reward Distribution: Discover flaws in how LPs are calculated and distributed \n- FLC Exploit: Manipulate the First Loss Capital mechanism to unfairly shift losses, avoid liability, or directly drain funds from the pool\n\n*Interaction of SAV & Lending Protocol with compliance primitives:* \n- Access Control: Bypass administrative controls or privileged functions (The lending protocol supports permissioned access both on the borrower and lender side, via on-chain primitives such as permissioned domains, credentials - we wnat to make sure the protocol can work with these without security tradeoffs) \n\n**Which chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?**\n\n- XRP Ledger\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nWe are targeting institutions with this protocol, which means that the collateral is not onchain. They might want to keep the collateral with crypto custodians like Bitgo for example. This does not directly affect the code, but the researchers should take into account that part of the loan lifecycle will be manually coordinated. \n\n**Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?**\n\nNot unusual, but it's something to remember: there are no smart contracts or hooks on the XRPL.\n\n**What are the most valuable educational resources already available? (Ie. Documentation, Explainer videos or articles, etc)**\n\n- https://immunefi.com/audit-competition/xrpl-ripple/resources",
