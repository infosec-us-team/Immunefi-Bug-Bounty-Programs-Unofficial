This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports and High/Critical severity for Smart Contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.  \n\nIn addition, critical/high/medium severity bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward.  \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 25 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 10 000__ only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than __USD 5 000__.\n\nKnown Issues highlighted in their previous audit reports are considered out of scope:\n  - [https://2293742169-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEdR1hjqLnI70JdgoNmhb%2Fuploads%2FTxAYFZgd3xC4gPWJCnG3%2FGeodefi%20Withdrawal%20Pool%20Audit%202022-05.final.pdf?alt=media&token=8086e25b-9422-4f7a-af9f-fcdc0cc779ef](https://2293742169-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEdR1hjqLnI70JdgoNmhb%2Fuploads%2FTxAYFZgd3xC4gPWJCnG3%2FGeodefi%20Withdrawal%20Pool%20Audit%202022-05.final.pdf?alt=media&token=8086e25b-9422-4f7a-af9f-fcdc0cc779ef) \n  - [https://2293742169-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEdR1hjqLnI70JdgoNmhb%2Fuploads%2FJb2TAw5y4DsFHPes3OvP%2FGeodefi%20Portal%20Audit%202022-08.final.pdf?alt=media&token=0c82e6da-33e9-4875-aeec-fda13c45a480](https://2293742169-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEdR1hjqLnI70JdgoNmhb%2Fuploads%2FJb2TAw5y4DsFHPes3OvP%2FGeodefi%20Portal%20Audit%202022-08.final.pdf?alt=media&token=0c82e6da-33e9-4875-aeec-fda13c45a480)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Geode Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
