      "programOverview": "Lombard is on a mission to unlock Bitcoin's potential as a dynamic financial tool by connecting it to DeFi with LBTC. LBTC is a secure Bitcoin LST, developed by Lombard on top of Babylon. It's a yield-bearing, natively cross-chain, liquid Bitcoin backed 1:1 by BTC. With LBTC, Bitcoin can be held as a store of value and simultaneously used to lend, borrow, stake, trade, and transfer in DeFi across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\n\nFounded in April 2024, Lombard is dedicated to unlocking Bitcoin's potential as a dynamic financial tool by connecting it to DeFi.  Lombard is building the universal standard for Bitcoin. Secured by Bitcoin-aligned ecosystem players, Lombard enables the yield-bearing BTC to move cross-chain without fragmenting liquidity, paving the way to become the single largest catalyst for onboarding net new capital into DeFi.\n\nBitcoin represents over 50% of the cryptocurrency market. But its interoperability with DeFi has been limited to date. \n\nOur flagship product, LBTC—a yield-bearing, cross-chain, liquid Bitcoin backed 1:1 by BTC— changes this and brings DeFi interoperability to ‘digital gold’. For the first time Bitcoin can be held as a store of value, and simultaneously used to earn, stake, trade, and transfer in DeFi at scale. Jump to LBTC.\n\nLBTC opens up new opportunities for Bitcoin holders to earn, stake, and trade on-chain, all while retaining Bitcoin as a store of value. For DeFi protocols, LBTC provides increased liquidity and user activity by unlocking $1.4 trillion new capital.\n\nLombard is currently live on Ethereum mainnet in Public Beta, where eligible participants are staking native BTC and minting LBTC.\n\nFor more information about Lombard, please visit [https://www.lombard.finance/](https://www.lombard.finance/)\n\nLombard provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nLombard will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nLombard adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- All issues covered by previous audits.\n- All issues previously reported via bug bounty or audit competitions.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nLombard’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/lombard-finance/evm-smart-contracts/tree/main/docs/audit](https://github.com/lombard-finance/evm-smart-contracts/tree/main/docs/audit). Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Lombard has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Lombard’s codebase can be found at [https://github.com/lombard-finance](https://github.com/lombard-finance). Documentation and further resources can be found on [https://docs.lombard.finance/](https://github.com/lombard-finance).",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 250 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of $10,000 to $50,000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional [24h] that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__For critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with USD 30 000, only if the impact leads to:__\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of USD 15 000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Lombard team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
