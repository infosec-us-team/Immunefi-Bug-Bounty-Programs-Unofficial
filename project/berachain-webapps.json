      "programOverview": "Berachain is a high-performance EVM-Identical Layer 1 (L1) blockchain utilizing Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) as a consensus mechanism and built on top of a modular EVM-focused consensus client framework named BeaconKit.\n\nBeaconKit is a modular framework for building EVM-based consensus clients. The framework offers the most user-friendly way to build and operate an EVM blockchain while ensuring a functionally identical execution environment to the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nFor more information about Berachain, please visit our [docs](https://docs.berachain.com/) or our [code](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit).\n\nBerachain provides rewards in BERA on Berachain, denominated in USD. Please see the **Rewards by Threat Level** section below for more details about the payment process. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nBerachain will be requesting KYC information to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with the address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government ID\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement outlined in this program and cannot be:\n\n- On OFAC SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors who directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nBerachain adheres to **category 3 - Approval Required**. This Policy determines what information researchers can make public from their submitted bug reports. For more details on the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\nBerachain adheres to the Primacy of Rules, meaning the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated on this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC demonstrating the bug's impact is required for this program and must comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously discovered bugs are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nBerachain’s completed audit reports will be available soon. Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may receive valid reports (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the bug's impact, which are not viable or would require unconventional action.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) that, by default, state what security researchers and projects can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Berachain has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",

The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Berachain team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are made in BERA on Berachain.\n\nThe net amount rewarded is calculated based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
