With an elegant system of four smart contracts, Metronome has had success with its daily auctions and DEX functionality. Since Metronome’s launch, DeFi has evolved due to the composable nature of protocols. Relaunching Metronome will provide upgraded token features, security enhancements, DeFi composability, a new development roadmap, and the formation of a Metronome DAO.\n\nFor more information about Metronome, please visit [https://www.metronome.io/](https://www.metronome.io/)",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nBounty payouts will be dependent on actual risk to the platform.  Total bounty will either be the minimum of the range, or 5% of the total funds that could be lost in the exploit (up to the maximum cap based on the tier severity) - whichever amount is greater.\n\nAll smart contract and web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Bug reports are required to include a runnable PoC in order to prove impact. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [https://github.com/autonomoussoftware/metronome-synth-audit/wiki/Audit](https://github.com/autonomoussoftware/metronome-synth-audit/wiki/Audit)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Metronome__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
