Since Metronome’s launch, DeFi has evolved due to the composable nature of protocols.

Total bounty will either be the minimum of the range, or 5% of the total funds that could be lost in the exploit (up to the maximum cap based on the tier severity) - whichever amount is greater.\n\nAll smart contract and web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Bug reports are required to include a runnable PoC in order to prove impact. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [https://github.com/autonomoussoftware/metronome-synth-audit/wiki/Audit](https://github.com/autonomoussoftware/metronome-synth-audit/wiki/Audit)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Metronome__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
