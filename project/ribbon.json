Structured products are packaged financial instruments that use a\ncombination of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-return objective, such as betting on volatility, enhancing yields or principal protection.  \n\nOne of its products, Theta Vault, is a yield-focused strategy on ETH and WBTC. The first Theta Vault will run a covered call strategy, which earns yield on a weekly basis through writing out of the money covered calls and collecting the premiums.\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly\nconcerned with the loss of user funds.",
