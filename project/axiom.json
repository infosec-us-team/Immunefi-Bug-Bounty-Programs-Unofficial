Axiom provides smart contracts trustless access to all on-chain historic data and arbitrary expressive compute over it.  Queries into Axiom are trustlessly fulfilled with ZK-verified results on-chain. \n\nFor more information about Axiom, please visit [www.axiom.xyz](http://www.axiom.xyz)\n\nAxiom provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n- National ID\n- Utility Bill\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nAxiom adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAxiom adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nAxiom commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Axiom will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nAxiom has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n\n__Invoicing Information__\n\nIf needed by the security researcher, Axiom is able to provide the necessary information for the proper issuance of an invoice.

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 50 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 25 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__  \n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- Citizens or residents of OFAC-sanctioned countries\n- Individuals on an OFAC sanctions list\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Smart Contract - Low\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Axiom team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC. \n",
