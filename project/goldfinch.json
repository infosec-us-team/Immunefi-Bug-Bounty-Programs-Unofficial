      "programOverview": "Goldfinch is a decentralized protocol that allows for crypto borrowing without crypto collateral. The Goldfinch protocol has four core participants: Borrowers, Backers, Liquidity Providers, and Auditors.\n\nBorrowers are participants who seek financing, and they propose Borrower Pools for the Backers to assess. Borrower Pools contain the terms a Borrower seeks, like the interest rate and repayment schedule.\n\nBackers assess the Borrower Pools and decide whether to supply first-loss capital. After Backers supply capital, Borrowers can borrow and repay through the Borrower Pool.\n\nLiquidity Providers supply capital to the Senior Pool in order to earn passive yield. The Senior Pool uses the Leverage Model to automatically allocate capital to the Borrower Pools, based on how many Backers are participating in them. When the Senior Pool allocates capital, a portion of its interest is reallocated to the Backers. This increases the Backers’ effective yield, which incentives them to both provide the higher-risk first-loss capital and do the work of assessing Borrower Pools.\n\nLastly, Auditors vote to approve Borrowers, which is required before they can borrow. Auditors are randomly selected by the protocol, and they provide a human-level check to guard against fraudulent activity.\n\nFor more information about Goldfinch, please visit [https://goldfinch.finance/](https://goldfinch.finance/).     \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Loss of user funds\n  - Loss of governance funds\n  - Incorrect or unintended behavior relating to money transfers (ie. user input is for 10 USDC, and we actually try to move 100 USDC)\n  - Logical bugs relating to calculation of interest or principal owed, or payment dates, etc.\n  - Temporary freezing of user or governance funds.\n  - Unable to call smart contract\n  - Pointing to an incorrect smart contract from our frontend",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward.\n\n“Clickjacking state-changing” is considered “High” if it could result in greater than __USD 10 000__ worth of such damages. \n\nThe payout for critical and high severity bugs is calculated as the minimum of 10% of economic damage from the exploit and the maximum payout for the exploit’s severity level; however there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ for valid critical bug reports, and a minimum reward of __USD 1 000__ for valid high severity bug reports.\n\nIn order to be eligible for a reward, the following terms and conditions must be met:\n\n  - Identify an original, previously unreported, non-public vulnerability within the scope of the Goldfinch bug bounty program as described.\n  - Include sufficient detail in your disclosure to enable our engineers to quickly reproduce, understand, and fix the vulnerability.\n  - Be at least 18 years of age.\n  - Be reporting in an individual capacity, or if employed by a company, reporting with the company’s written approval to submit a disclosure to Goldfinch.\n  - Not be subject to US sanctions or reside in a US-embargoed country.\n  - Not be a current or former Goldfinch employee, vendor, contractor, or employee of a Goldfinch vendor or contractor.\n\nVulnerabilities in contracts built on top of Goldfinch by third-party developers (such as smart contract wallets) are not in-scope, nor are vulnerabilities that require ownership of an admin key.\n\nKnown bugs found at the following link are considered out of scope for the program:\n\n[https://goldfinchfinance.notion.site/ImmuneFi-Publication-List-of-Known-Goldfinch-Protocol-Issues-2a222523415640f886d1bb8f10f622ef](https://goldfinchfinance.notion.site/ImmuneFi-Publication-List-of-Known-Goldfinch-Protocol-Issues-2a222523415640f886d1bb8f10f622ef)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Goldfinch__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
