      "programOverview": "Lybra Finance Protocol is a cutting-edge decentralized platform designed to bring stability to the volatile world of cryptocurrency. It primarily operates on Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), with ETH and other supported ETH proof-of-stake LSTs as its main components.\n\nFor more information about Lybra Finance, please visit [https://lybra.finance/.  ](https://lybra.finance/)\n\nLybra Finance provides rewards in LBR or USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nLybra Finance adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nLybra Finance adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Smart Contract, Critical\n- Smart Contract, High\n- Smart Contract, Medium\n- Smart Contract, Low\n- Smart Contract, Informational\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nLybra Finance commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Lybra Finance will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nLybra Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\nTo determine the final reward amount, the likelihood to have a meaningful impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds is considered.
