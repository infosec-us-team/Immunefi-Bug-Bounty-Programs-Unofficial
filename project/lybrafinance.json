      "programOverview": "Lybra Finance Protocol is a cutting-edge decentralized platform designed to bring stability to the volatile world of cryptocurrency. It primarily operates on Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), with ETH and other supported ETH proof-of-stake LSTs as its main components.\n\nFor more information about Lybra Finance, please visit [https://lybra.finance/.  ](https://lybra.finance/)\n\nLybra Finance provides rewards in LBR or USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nLybra Finance adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nLybra Finance adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Smart Contract, Critical\n- Smart Contract, High\n- Smart Contract, Medium\n- Smart Contract, Low\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nLybra Finance commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Lybra Finance will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nLybra Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. Learn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact).\n\nAll smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\nTo determine the final reward amount, the likelihood to have a meaningful impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds is considered. The final decision on the payout amount will be determined by the Lybra Finance team at its discretion.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope:\n\nCode4rena Audit Report: [https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-06-lybra](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-06-lybra)\nConsensys Audit Report: [https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/2023/08/lybra-finance/](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/2023/08/lybra-finance/)\nHalborn Audit Report: [https://bit.ly/45LIVzd](https://bit.ly/45LIVzd)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n\n- Smart Contract Critical severity impacts\n- Smart Contract High severity impacts\n- Smart Contract Medium severity impacts\n- Smart Contract Low severity impacts\n- Smart Contract Informational severity impacts\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the [Immunefi-wide PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Lybra Finance team directly and are denominated in __USD__. Payouts are done in __USDC or LBR__, at the discretion of the Lybra Finance team.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "These impacts are out of scope for this bug bounty program. \n\n__All Categories__\n\nThe following impacts and attack vectors are excluded from rewards by default for all Immunefi bug bounty programs: \n\n- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist), except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Broken link hijacking is out of scope\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n- Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity\n- Best practice critiques\n- Sybil attacks\n- Centralization risks",
