By combining the strengths of centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) while mitigating their respective weaknesses, MUFEX aims to revolutionize the landscape of decentralized trading. Launched in 2023, users can enjoy secure and seamless trading on MUFEX with leverage of up to 150X. With a wide selection of contract trading assets, a comprehensive range of trading services, and a robust ecosystem, MUFEX enables users worldwide to experience secure, transparent, and fair trading services.\n\nFor more information about MUFEX, please visit [https://www.mufex.finance/](https://www.mufex.finance/).\n\nMUFEX provides rewards in USDT. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nMUFEX adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication ](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/)page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nMUFEX adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severities:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Websites & Applications - Critical\n- Websites & Applications - High\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nMUFEX commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that MUFEX will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nMUFEX has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nMUFEX has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://github.com/numencyber/AuditReport/blob/main/Mufex%20Penetration%20Test%20Report%20v0.2.pdf](https://github.com/numencyber/AuditReport/blob/main/Mufex%20Penetration%20Test%20Report%20v0.2.pdf)\n- [https://metatrust.io/score/audit/mufex](https://metatrust.io/score/audit/mufex)\n- [https://github.com/Secure3Audit/Secure3Academy/tree/main/audit_reports/Mufex](https://github.com/Secure3Audit/Secure3Academy/tree/main/audit_reports/Mufex)\n\n __Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Web/App - Critical\n- Web/App - High\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the MUFEX team directly and are denominated in USD.
