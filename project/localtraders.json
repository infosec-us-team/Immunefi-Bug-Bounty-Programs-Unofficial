Using their native token, LCT, customers may make cheaper purchases, engage in trade, receive Legal/tax assistance, and stake for future gains.\n\nFor more information about Local Traders, please visit https://www.localtraders.finance/bug-bounty\n\nLocal Traders provide rewards combining Tether (USDT) in 80% of the payout and LCT Token (LCT) in 20% of the payout. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nLocal Traders adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nLocal Traders’ completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/localtradersteam/Certik-Audit-report](https://github.com/localtradersteam/Certik-Audit-report). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n \nFor critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with USD $10,000, only if the impact leads to:\n\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds\n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of USD 5 000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n\n- Web-App  - Critical - PoC Required\n- Web-App  - High - PoC Required\n- Web-App - Medium - PoC Required\n- Web-App - Low - PoC Required\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC, when a PoC is required, will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Local Traders team directly and are denominated in USD. The payment scheme involves two forms of currency: Tether (USDT) and LCT Token (LCT). 80% of the total payout is made in Tether, while the remaining 20% is made in LCT Token.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For the avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n\nPayouts will be paid in up to 10 working days after the validation has been completed.",
