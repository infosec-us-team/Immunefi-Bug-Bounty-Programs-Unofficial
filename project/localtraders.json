      "programOverview": "Local Traders is a network that facilitates P2P exchange between buyers and sellers of cryptocurrency and other people interested in the market's many possibilities. Using their native token, LCT, customers may make cheaper purchases, engage in trade, receive Legal/tax assistance, and stake for future gains. With LOCAL TRADERS, Latin America and the Caribbean are now recognised as a major player in the global cryptocurrency market. With almost a billion dollars in weekly p2p transactions, LATAM's local merchants have a bright future ahead of them.\n\nFor more information about Local Traders, please visit [https://www.localtraders.finance/](https://www.localtraders.finance/)  \n\nLocal Traders  provides rewards combining Tether (USDT) in 70% of the payout and LCT Token (LCT) in 30% of the payout. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nLocal Traders adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nLocal Traders adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nLocal Traders commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Local Traders will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nLocal Traders has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 5% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 20 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 15 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nLocal Traders has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://www.certik.com/projects/local-traders?utm_source=CMC&utm_campaign=AuditByCertiKLink](https://www.certik.com/projects/local-traders?utm_source=CMC&utm_campaign=AuditByCertiKLink)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical - PoC Required\n- Smart Contract - High - PoC Required\n- Smart Contract - Medium - PoC Required\n- Smart Contract - Low - PoC Required\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\nWe are looking for evidence and reasons for incorrect behavior of the smart contract, which could cause unintended functionality: \n- Theoretical vulnerabilities without any proof or demonstration\n- Old compiler version\n- The compiler version is not locked\n- Vulnerabilities in imported contracts\n- Code style guide violations\n- Redundant code\n- Gas optimizations\n- Best practice issues\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Local Traders team directly and are denominated in USD. The payment scheme involves two forms of currency: Tether (USDT) and LCT Token (LCT). 70% of the total payout is made in Tether, while the remaining 30% is made in LCT Token.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n\nPayouts will be paid in up to 10 working days after the validation has been completed.\n",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "These impacts are out of scope for this bug bounty program. \n\n__All Categories__\n\n- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist) except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code\n- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Feature requests\n- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity impacts\n- Impacts from Sybil attacks\n- Impacts involving centralization risks\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Theoretical vulnerabilities without any proof or demonstration\n- Old compiler version\n- The compiler version is not locked\n- Vulnerabilities in imported contracts\n- Code style guide violations\n- Redundant code\n- Gas optimizations\n- Best practice issues\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n- Any testing on mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on local-forks of either public testnet or mainnet\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third-party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third-party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks that are executed against project assets\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n",
