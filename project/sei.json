This is denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.  \n\nSei Foundation has a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\nPlease refer to the following for KYC requirements:\n- Full Name\n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of passport or other government issued ID\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\nSei Foundation adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n- Blockchain/DLT: Critical\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nSei Foundation commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Sei Foundation will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nSei Foundation has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk,  which includes all affected projects on top of the respective blockchain/DLT, and the market cap according to the average between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com calculated at the time the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nThis ratio is known as the “risk ratio”, i.e.: Risk Ratio = Funds at Risk / Sei Foundation Market Cap\n\nThe reward is then calculated linearly from 0:1 to 1:1, where 1:1 results in a reward of USD $500,000. In the event of where the funds at risk are greater than the market cap, the maximum reward remains as the hard cap.\n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of USD $25,000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- User Would Lose Control Of The Deposit Funds In Limit Order When Unsuccessful Orders Is Returned From The WASM Contract\n- Project operation risk in tokenfactory and dex module\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nSei Foundation has provided these completed audit review reports for reference.

You can follow these steps to provide this PoC:\n\n- Spin up the local testnet with `make docker-cluster-start`\n- Connect to node0 with `docker exec -it sei-node-0 /bin/bash`\n- Carry out attack\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Sei Foundation team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in SEI.\n\nSEI is used, it will be the average of closing price from coingecko over 5 days to determine the quantity of SEI to be given.",

      "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
