      "programOverview": "Vyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nFor more information about Vyper, please visit [https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/)\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on finding vulnerabilities in live smart contracts of participating protocols that use the Vyper compiler. You can think of this program as an “extra incentive” on existing Vyper-based protocols’ bug bounties. \n\nFor example, if you find a Vyper compiler bug that results in a Critical impact on a Yearn contract, where the Yearn payout would be $200,000, and Yearn is participating in this program, you’d get an additional $50,000 from this bounty. \n\nThis program has an expiration date of September 14th, 2023, and will be followed by a Vyper compiler competitive audit on [CodeHawks](https://codehawks.com/), and then a long-term bug bounty on the Vyper compiler. Details on those to come. \n\n__Participating Protocols__\n\nProtocols participating are: \n- [Yearn](https://immunefi.com/bounty/yearnfinance/) ($50,000)\n- [Lido](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lido/) ($50,000)\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nVyper adheres to category 2. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nVyper adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nVyper commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Vyper will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\nVyper provides rewards in USDC, DAI, YFI, ETH, RAI, or LDO depending on the asset and protocol at risk. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $50,000 per protocol and $100,000 if both Yearn & Lido are at risk. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $20,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nThe reward calculation for high level reports will reflect the respective protocol bounties as a percentage of their payout. \n\nFor example, if Yearn pays a $20,000 payout out of a possible $20,000 payout, this means 100% of the payout was made, therefore, this bounty will pay out $50,000 (100% of the per protocol award). \n\nIf Yearn pays $10,000 out of a possible $20,000, this is a 50% payout, and this bounty will pay $25,000 of the max $50,000.\n\nPlease refer to Yearn and Lido bounties on Immunefi for max payouts from the participating protocol.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- OFAC-sanctioned countries\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged by each protocol are not eligible for wards. \n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nAt Immunefi, we sometimes receive reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. If it’s obviously feasible, then it seems there are no questions about severity or payout amount. But if the bug report is less feasible, or not really feasible at all, suddenly questions arise.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards)which by default states what a Projects should or should not cite when downgrading a bug report’s impact, severity, and/or payout amount. These standards are continuously being developed and updated  with help of the community and encompasses fair guidelines where the project clearly commits, and the security researcher can be assured that the project cannot arbitrarily downgrade the program based on theoretical counter measures, such as a [chain rollback. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract: Critical\n- Smart Contract: High\n- Smart Contract: Medium\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\nThe following contracts are in scope:\n- Any contract participating in this program (see above for a list of participating)\n- Use the Vyper compiler \n- Have more than $10,000 USD worth of assets at risk\n- The contract was deployed before July 28th, 2023\n\nThe Vyper Security Alliance will be helping triage if the bug is a vyper compiler issue before sending off to the protocol for review. \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Vyper team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC, DAI, YFI, ETH, RAI, or LDO depending on the asset and protocol at risk. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\nThe Vyper team will be responsible for payout of this portion of the bounty, but not the participating protocol’s.\n",
