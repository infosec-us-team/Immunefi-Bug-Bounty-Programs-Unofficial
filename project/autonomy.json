      "programOverview": "Autonomy Network is an off-the-shelf generalized automation solution, empowering the Web3 with on-chain conditional execution. A decentralized network built on users, executors and the blockchain. It’s a B2B infrastructure tool used by dapps to add features, like limit orders, stop losses, and impermanent loss prevention.\n\nFor more information about Autonomy Network, please visit [https://www.autonomynetwork.io/](https://www.autonomynetwork.io/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Theft or loss of value of funds on any contract\n  - Attack that would modify or change the requirements of an order\n  - Attack that would invalidate the execution of an order \n  - Dos for order executing bots",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__ \n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Solidity/EVM details not considered\n    - including integer over-/under-flow\n    - including rounding errors\n    - including unhandled exceptions\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n  - Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n  - Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. All High and Medium Smart Contract bug reports require a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward.  \n\nIn addition to Immunefi’s Vulnerability Severity Classification System, Autonomy Network classifies the following vulnerabilities as follows. In case of discrepancy, the one below will be followed.\n\n__Critical__\n  - Theft or loss of value of funds on any contract\n\n__High__\n  - Attack that would modify or change the requirements of an order\n\n__Medium__\n  - Attack that would invalidate the execution of an order\n\n__Low__\n  - Dos for order executing bots\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - ‘Miner’ contract in [https://github.com/Autonomy-Network/autonomy-contracts](https://github.com/Autonomy-Network/autonomy-contracts)\n\n  - Issues addressed in [https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/autonomy/Autonomy%20report.pdf](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/autonomy/Autonomy%20report.pdf)\n\n  - Issues addressed in [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eg3OeaHRT0NcyV6IpAlwZhvhU6mZoBDG?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eg3OeaHRT0NcyV6IpAlwZhvhU6mZoBDG?usp=sharing)\n\n  - Executors can choose not to execute and essentially censor requests from execution temporarily\n  - Executors can uniquely frontrun limit orders\n  - The `owner` can change the oracle price, and change the default token used to pay etc, which affect users\n  - The gas refunded is not the correct amount\n  - Requests can be spammed and fill up the Registry\n  - Overflows can occur from user-inputted value, such as in the line `uniArgs.amountOutMax * tradeInput / msg.value`\n  - Users can waste the gas of executors by making them think something is executable, then frontrunning it to make it not executable\n  - An executor can manipulate when an order is triggerable by taking out a flash loan and moving the market before the execution in but in the same transaction\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Autonomy Network__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT, DAI or ETH__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team. ",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n  - Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n  - Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__\n\n  - Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n    - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n  - Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n  - Lack of liquidity\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Sybil attacks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n  - Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n  - Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n  - Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n  - Any denial of service attacks\n  - Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n  - Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",
