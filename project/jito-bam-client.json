This design maintains network security while enabling sophisticated transaction ordering strategies.\n\nThe validator client supports traditional Solanar transactions as well as Jito Bundles on Solana. You can download the validator client [here](https://github.com/jito-labs/bam-client) and pass a the closest BAM Node URL on the command line.\n\nThe BAM Validator operates in one of three distinct modes:\n\n| Mode | Description | Scheduler | Bundle/Txn Source | \n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Normal Agave | Standard Solana Validator | Internal Agave Scheduler | TPU Ingestion |\n| Block Engine | Jito enhanced operation | Internal with Block Engine | Jito Block Engine & (Relayer TPU or TPU) |\n| BAM | External scheduler Delegation | External BAM Scheduler | BAM Node via gRPC |\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nJito - BAM Client will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n- Likeness test to verify identity\n\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n- On OFAC's SDN list or the sanctions list of the United Kingdom or European Union or pursuant to sanctions imposed by the United Nations\n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nJito - BAM Client adheres to  **Category 3: Approval Required** . This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nJito - BAM Client adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward $100,000. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown) - $100,000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork) - $100,000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork) - $100,000\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk, which includes all affected projects on top of the respective blockchain/DLT, and the market cap according to the average between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com, calculated at the time the bug report is submitted. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high Blockchain/DLT non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Unintended chain split (network partition) - $50,000\n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments - $50,000\n\nPayouts are handled by the Jito Foundation directly and reward amounts are denominated in USD. However, payments are made in JTO on Solana.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
