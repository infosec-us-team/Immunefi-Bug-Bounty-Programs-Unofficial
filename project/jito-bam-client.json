  "programOverview": "For more information about the Jito -  BAM Client, please visit https://bam.dev.\n\nAny Bug Bounty relating to the BAM client will be provided in JTO, denominated in USD and pursuant to payment terms below.\n\nFor more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section.\n\n__BAM Client__\n\nThe BAM Client extends the Jito-Solana client to interface with external schedulers (BAM Nodes) that run inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) via gRPC, receiving pre-sequenced transaction bundles and executing them in FIFO order with respect to account locks. This design maintains network security while enabling sophisticated transaction ordering strategies.\n\nThe validator client supports traditional Solanar transactions as well as Jito Bundles on Solana. You can download the validator client [here](https://github.com/jito-labs/bam-client) and pass a the closest BAM Node URL on the command line.\n\nThe BAM Validator operates in one of three distinct modes:\n\n| Mode | Description | Scheduler | Bundle/Txn Source | \n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Normal Agave | Standard Solana Validator | Internal Agave Scheduler | TPU Ingestion |\n| Block Engine | Jito enhanced operation | Internal with Block Engine | Jito Block Engine & (Relayer TPU or TPU) |\n| BAM | External scheduler Delegation | External BAM Scheduler | BAM Node via gRPC |\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nJito - BAM Client will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n- Likeness test to verify identity\n\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n- On OFAC's SDN list or the sanctions list of the United Kingdom or European Union or pursuant to sanctions imposed by the United Nations\n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nJito - BAM Client adheres to  **Category 3: Approval Required** . This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nJito - BAM Client adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page.",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward $100,000. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown) - $100,000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork) - $100,000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork) - $100,000\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk, which includes all affected projects on top of the respective blockchain/DLT, and the market cap according to the average between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com, calculated at the time the bug report is submitted. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high Blockchain/DLT non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Unintended chain split (network partition) - $50,000\n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments - $50,000\n\nPayouts are handled by the Jito Foundation directly and reward amounts are denominated in USD. However, payments are made in JTO on Solana.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the 7-day [TWAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted_average_price?utm_source=immunefi) of JTO at the time of settlement. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",

  "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",

  "customOutOfScopeInformation": "Bounties apply only to vulnerabilities discovered in the listed repositories and code maintained by Jito Labs/Jito Foundation. This project is a fork of https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave; vulnerabilities that are present only in the upstream project and are not introduced or affected by the BAM Client fork are out of scope for rewards under this Bug Bounty Program. If a reported issue exists both in the BAM client fork and upstream please also report that to the agave bug bounty program.\n\nThe BAM node, which communicates with the BAM Client, is also out of scope and should be assumed as trusted for purposes of any submission. However if there are vulnerabilities that can impact the BAM Client which assume a malicious, misconfigured, or misbehaving BAM node, rewards may be considered on a discretionary basis. Note that since the BAM node code is closed source, at this time, submissions exploring a malicious BAM node may not be possible based on how the software is architected and therefore will not or may not require or result in any changes to the code for the BAM Client to remediate theoretical vulnerabilities.",
