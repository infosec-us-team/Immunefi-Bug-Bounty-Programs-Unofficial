This is a temporary measure as we work out any undiscovered bugs in our testing during this network transition. We still welcome reports during this transition, but be aware there will likely be a reduced payout until the network upgrade is finalized. \n\nStacks is a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts; it enables smart contracts and decentralized applications to use Bitcoin as an asset and settle transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the upcoming Nakamoto release of Stacks, Stacks will be secured by the entire hash power of Bitcoin, giving it Bitcoin finality.\n\nFor more information about Stacks, please visit [https://stacks.org/](https://stacks.org/) and [https://www.stacks.co/](https://www.stacks.co/). \n\nWe at the Stacks Foundation maintain essential components of the Stacks blockchain infrastructure. Our security team prioritizes the following attack vectors:\n\n  - Theft of funds\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Total network shutdown or denial-of-service vectors\n  - Chain split or deep fork vectors\n  - Invalid transactions processing successfully or confirming\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Remotely exploitable weaknesses (as triggered through standard Stacks     - RPC and P2P ports only)\n  - (In smart contracts) Vote manipulation\n  - (In smart contracts) Block stuffing attacks\n  - (In smart contracts) Theft or loss of unclaimed rewards",

      "description": "During a planned network upgrade, and with a 3 month window after the last hard fork is released, we’ve lowered the payouts for all classes of bug reports. This is a temporary measure as we work out any undiscovered bugs in our testing during this network transition. We still welcome reports during this transition, but be aware there will likely be a reduced payout until the network upgrade is finalized.",

      "feasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
