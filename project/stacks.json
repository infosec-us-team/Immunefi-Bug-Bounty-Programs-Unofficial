Stacks is secured by the entire hash power of Bitcoin, giving it Bitcoin finality.\n\nsBTC is a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset, enabling users to put their BTC to work in DeFi, dApps, and other applications. It leverages Stacks’ programmability and Bitcoin finality to enable a new Bitcoin economy.\n\nFor more information about Stacks and sBTC, please visit [https://stacks.org/](https://stacks.org/), [https://www.stacks.co/](https://www.stacks.co/) and [https://www.stacks.co/sbtc](https://www.stacks.co/sbtc)\n\nWe at the Stacks Foundation maintain essential components of the Stacks blockchain infrastructure, including sBTC. Our security team prioritizes the following attack vectors:\n\n  - Theft of funds\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Total network shutdown or unauthenticated denial-of-service vectors\n  - Chain split or deep fork vectors\n  - Invalid transactions processing successfully or confirming\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Remotely exploitable weaknesses (as triggered through standard Stacks     - RPC and P2P ports only)\n  - (In smart contracts) Vote manipulation\n  - (In smart contracts) Block stuffing attacks\n  - (In smart contracts) Theft or loss of unclaimed rewards",
