Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\nIn contract 0x014127E127C6788BaDaE75Ba213a58Ac22944c82 , a potential sandwith attack may occur when swap because we ignore slippage control.\nSome tokens may be left on contract 0x014127E127C6788BaDaE75Ba213a58Ac22944c82 when transferring tokens to Liquidity Pool or BNB to Liquidity Pool.\n\nAll vulnerabilities marked in the [BlockSec security review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vPRgBm1G61UP8Iwbllo2_LC_W9btWA2W/view?usp=sharing) and [Peckshield security review 1st report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kcOPfov05cky5uAbNW9bMsEENuMEXCc/view?usp=sharing) , [Peckshield security review 2nd report](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Duet-Bond-v1.0.pdf) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Duet Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT and bDUET (which is abbreviation for bonded DUET or you can simply understand unvested DUET, and the sessions here that will mature in less than half a year, specific terms to be negotiable case by case)__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.",
