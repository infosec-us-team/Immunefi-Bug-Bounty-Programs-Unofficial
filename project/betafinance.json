They stand by the DeFi ethos of \"Open Finance For All\" and seek to re-define finance by providing a foundational block in DeFi that future projects will be built upon.\n\nFor more information about Beta Finance, please visit [https://betafinance.org/](https://betafinance.org/).  \n\nThe bug bounty program covers its smart contracts and is focused on preventing thefts and freezing of principal of any amount.",
