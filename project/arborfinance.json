This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope and a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Any issues related to malicious or exploitable tokens being added to the allow-list. It is assumed that all tokens will strictly adhere to the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation\n  - Intended protocol behavior (borrowers have the ability to default)\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Using flash loan to pay and retrieve collateral without monetary impact\n  - Different payment/collateral amounts given past maturity within expected ratios (issuer may repay and cause redemption to vary in amount of payment/collateral)\n  - Rounding errors with unrealistic ratios\n  - Dust leftover in contracts\n  - Vulnerabilities requiring compromised owner's wallet\n  - In addition, issues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope:\n    - [https://github.com/alwaysbegrowing/arbor-contracts/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/alwaysbegrowing/arbor-contracts/tree/main/audits)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Arbor Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
