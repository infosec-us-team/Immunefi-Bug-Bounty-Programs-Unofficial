This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope and a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Any issues related to malicious or exploitable tokens being added to the allow-list. It is assumed that all tokens will strictly adhere to the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation\n  - Intended protocol behavior (borrowers have the ability to default)\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Using flash loan to pay and retrieve collateral without monetary impact\n  - Different payment/collateral amounts given past maturity within expected ratios (issuer may repay and cause redemption to vary in amount of payment/collateral)\n  - Rounding errors with unrealistic ratios\n  - Dust leftover in contracts\n  - Vulnerabilities requiring compromised owner's wallet\n  - In addition, issues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope:\n    - [https://github.com/alwaysbegrowing/arbor-contracts/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/alwaysbegrowing/arbor-contracts/tree/main/audits)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Arbor Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
