Acre provides a simple method for Bitcoin holders to benefit from the growth of Bitcoin scaling without losing exposure to BTC price.  \nStrictly designed for a \"bitcoin in, bitcoin out\" experience, Acre is a portal to broad exposure by supporting Bitcoin scaling with minimal user effort. Acre supports native BTC deposits via Thresholds programmable and decentralized BTC bridge.\nAcre's goal is to offer the benefits of earning rewards on idle BTC without deep technical know-how. It is important to note that each transaction within the Acre protocol is completely visible on-chain for everyone to monitor.\n\nFor more information about Acre, please visit https://acre.fi\nAcre provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD.",

      "assetsBodyV2": "__Asset Accuracy Assurance__\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n__Private Known Issues Reward Policy__\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nAcre commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Acre Finance will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAcre adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n**Critical**\n\n- Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n- Permanent freezing of funds\n- Protocol insolvency\n\n\n**High**\n\n- Theft of unclaimed yield\n- Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n- Temporary freezing of funds\n\n\n**Medium**\n\n- Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds\n- Block stuffing\n- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)\n- Theft of gas\n- Unbounded gas consumption\n\n**Low**\n\n- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value\n\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see Best Practices: Primacy of Impact \nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this [Program Type]ed bug bounty and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Acre has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\nThis is not an upgrade.\n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs? Useful aspects of this question are:__\n\nThe stBTC contract is based on the ERC4626 token vault. Attacks resulting in breaking the vault invariants and manipulating the shares conversion ratio are considered significant threats. We want to focus on users funds security.\n\n__What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?__\n\nAcre’s stBTC implements the ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard. By staking tBTC, users acquire a liquid staking token called stBTC, commonly referred to as \"shares\". Users have the flexibility to redeem stBTC, enabling them to withdraw their deposited tBTC along with the accrued yield. stBTC is a non-rebasing ERC4626 token.\n\n__What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?__\n\nPausing stBTC contract, upgarde of contracts, adjusting minimum deposit limits\n\n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nContracts Owners, Pause Admin, Mezo Portal, Maintainers\n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nContracts Owners, Pause Admin\n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\n\nIn order to support a native bitcoin-in, bitcoin-out experience, Acre has integrated Threshold Network’s tBTC bridge, which is an existing technology. Deposited funds are allocated to the Mezo Portal contract.\n\n__Where might whitehats confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?__\n\nExternal libraries are out-of-scope (i.e. @openzeppelin).\n\n__What is the test suite setup information?__\n\nhttps://github.com/thesis/acre/tree/main/solidity#testing\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAcre’s completed audit reports can be found at:\n\n- https://github.com/Thesis-Defense/Security-Audit-Reports/blob/main/PDFs/240517_Thesis_Defense-Acre_Smart_Contracts_Security_Audit_Report.pdf\n- https://github.com/Thesis-Defense/Security-Audit-Reports/blob/main/PDFs/240808_Thesis_Defense-Mezo-Acre_stBTC_Smart_Contracts_Security_Audit_Report.pdf\n\nAny unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",
