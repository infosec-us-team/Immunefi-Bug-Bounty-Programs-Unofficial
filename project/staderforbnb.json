      "programOverview": "Stader is a non-custodial smart contract based staking platform that helps you conveniently discover and access staking solutions\n\nIn the short term, Stader is building native staking smart contracts across multiple chains including BNB, Fantom, Polygon, Solana, among others, and building an economic ecosystem to grow and develop solutions like YFI-style farming with rewards, launchpads, gaming with rewards, liquid staking solutions, and more.\n\nIn the long term, Stader is focused on unlocking the platform approach and nurturing third parties to develop several staking-related applications on top of Stader infrastructure.\n\nFor more information about Stader for BNB, please visit [https://staderlabs.com/](https://staderlabs.com/).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the  [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nPrevious issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope of this program: \n  - [https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/peckshield/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Stader-Binance.pdf](https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/peckshield/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Stader-Binance.pdf)\n  - [https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/binance/StaderLabs_BnbX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/binance/StaderLabs_BnbX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Stader__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ or __ETH__, at the discretion of the team.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n  - Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n  - Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__\n  - Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n    - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n  - Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n  - Lack of liquidity\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Sybil attacks\n  - Centralization risks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n  - Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n  - Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n  - Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n  - Any denial of service attacks\n  - Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n  - Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",
