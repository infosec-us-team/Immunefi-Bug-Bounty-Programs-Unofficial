      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the  [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nPrevious issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope of this program: \n  - [https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/peckshield/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Stader-Binance.pdf](https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/peckshield/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Stader-Binance.pdf)\n  - [https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/binance/StaderLabs_BnbX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/binance/StaderLabs_BnbX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Stader__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ or __ETH__, at the discretion of the team.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n  - Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n  - Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__\n  - Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n    - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n  - Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n  - Lack of liquidity\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Sybil attacks\n  - Centralization risks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n  - Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n  - Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n  - Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n  - Any denial of service attacks\n  - Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n  - Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",

When reporting a bug, please make sure to select the relevant proxy smart contract as the target.\n\nAll smart contracts of Stader for BNB can be found at [https://github.com/stader-labs/bnbX](https://github.com/stader-labs/bnbX). However, only those in the Assets in Scope table are considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nIf any Critical/High severity impact can be caused to any other asset managed by Stader for BNB that isnâ€™t on this table but for which the impact is in the Impacts in Scope section below, you are encouraged to submit it for the consideration by the project.",
