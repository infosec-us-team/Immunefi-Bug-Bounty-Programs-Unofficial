This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nPrevious issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope of this program: \n  - [https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/peckshield/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Stader-Binance.pdf](https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/peckshield/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Stader-Binance.pdf)\n  - [https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/binance/StaderLabs_BnbX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/binance/StaderLabs_BnbX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Stader__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
