Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 2,000,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 100,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.  \nAll High and Medium rewards for the project bug bounty program are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place. However, there is a minimum reward for each severity level, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities relating to those contracts are not eligible from this specific bounty, but can be submitted instead to [https://immunefi.com/bounty/starkex/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/starkex/):\n\n- [https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/tree/master/audit](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/tree/master/audit) \n- All vulnerabilities found in any audit documents in [https://github.com/rhinofi/contracts_public](https://github.com/rhinofi/contracts_public)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __rhino.fi__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
