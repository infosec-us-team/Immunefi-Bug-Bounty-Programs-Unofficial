This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nIn addition to assessing severity, the rewards will be considered based on the impact of the discovered vulnerability as well as the level of difficulty in discovering such vulnerability.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __DELV__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payouts are done in __DAI__ or __USDC__.\n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nDELV will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n  - Verified full name\n  - Address\n  - SSN (or equivalent)\n  - Country of residence.\n\n__Eligibility__\n\nTo be eligible for a reward under the DELV Bug Bounty Program, you must:\n\n  - Discover a previously unreported and non-public vulnerability that would result in a loss of or a lock on any ERC-20 token in Council.. Each bug will only be considered for a reward once. This does not include third-party platforms interacting with Council..\n\n  - Be the first to disclose the unique vulnerability through Immunefi, in compliance with the disclosure requirements with Immunefi and the section below.\n\n  - Provide sufficient information to enable our team to reproduce and fix the vulnerability.  This includes providing a PoC.\n\n  - Not engage in any unlawful conduct when disclosing the bug, including through threats, demands, or any other coercive tactics.\n\n  - Not exploit the vulnerability in any way, including through making it public or by obtaining a profit (other than the reward subject under this Program).\n\n  - Submit only one vulnerability per submission, unless you need to bundle vulnerabilities together in order to provide an accurate assessment of impact regarding any of the vulnerabilities.\n\n  - Not submit a vulnerability caused by an underlying issue that is the same as an issue on which a reward has been paid under this Program.\n\n  - Not be one of our current or former employees or contractors.\n",
