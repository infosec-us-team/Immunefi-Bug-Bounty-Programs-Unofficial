These permissionless and composable smart contracts provide superior user experiences across DeFi in a groundbreaking multichain yield ecosystem.\n\nOrigin Dollar (OUSD) is a new, fully backed stablecoin that was initially launched in September 2020 on the Ethereum network. Its design is superior to existing stablecoins because OUSD captures competitive yields while being passively held in wallets.\n\nFor more information about Origin Dollar, please visit [https://www.ousd.com/](https://www.ousd.com/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of funds\n  - Loss of more than 10% of yield\n  - Freezing of funds that cannot be undone by admin actions\n  - Ability for an unauthorized user to use admin actions\n  - Governance process failures\n  - Redirected funds by address modification\n  - Shell access on server\n  - Injection of text\n  - Ability to have other users run arbitrary code on the site\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nOrigin Protocol adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n  - Smart Contract: Critical\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nNon-deployed contracts on Github are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.",

Attacks which only change the mix of stablecoins, but do not reduce the total number of stablecoins held are excluded.\n\n  - Reductions in the number of backing stablecoins due to governance or strategist actions that move coins into or out of strategies, where the reduction comes from the normal fees of the underlying strategy or the price difference of stablecoins being moved in or out are excluded.\n\n  - Rounding in the flipper contract is intentional.\n  - Anything airdrop related in the old OGN staking contract at 0x501804B374EF06fa9C427476147ac09F1551B9A0\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports on smart contracts. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Origin Protocol__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
