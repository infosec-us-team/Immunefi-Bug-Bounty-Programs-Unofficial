      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll  bug reports must come with a detailed PoC demonstrating the exploit in a real-world scenario; and written instructions to reproduce, in order to be considered for a reward. Theoretical vulnerabilities without a working POC will not be accepted. \nThe payout for **critical vulnerabilities** is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk and the **combined market cap** (as listed on coinmarketcap on the day of the report) of the Moonbeam and Moonriver Blockchains. \n\nThe payout for __critical vulnerabilities__ is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk and the combined __market cap__ (as listed on coinmarketcap on the day of the report) of the Moonbeam and Moonriver Blockchains. \n\nThis ratio is known as the __“risk ratio”__, i.e.:\n\nRisk Ratio = Funds at Risk / ( Moonbeam Market Cap + Moonriver Market Cap)\n\nThe exact payout is determined as follows:\n\n  - If the risk ratio is at or below 0.5, the payout is calculated linearly between 2,500$ and 25K.\n  - If the risk ratio is above 0.5, the payout is calculated linearly between $25K and $100K; with a maximum cap of $100K\n\nThis results in the following payout graph:\n![MoonbeamNewGraph](https://images.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/1Ut1uZ8vGlefoKvPOHYylO/7c6634daa7ad500944c119c1b3cc78b3/photo_2024-11-21_06.23.27.jpeg)\n\nNote that a bug reported for one of either the Moonbeam or Moonriver networks that applies to both will be treated as a single report and paid only once. \n\nThe Moonbeam Foundation requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is an ID scan along with a selfie to verify identity. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Moonbeam Foundation__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__ or __USDC__.\n\nThe Moonriver parachain on Kusama and the Moonbeam parachain on Polkadot (estimated launch in Jan 2022) are both included in the assets-in-scope. \n\nAll source code of Moonbeam can be found at [https://github.com/PureStake/](https://github.com/PureStake/).
