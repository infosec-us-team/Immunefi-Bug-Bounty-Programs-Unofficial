This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam benefits from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. \n\nFor more information about Moonbeam Network, please visit [https://moonbeam.network/](https://moonbeam.network/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their Moonriver and Moonbeam parachains (deployed to Kusama and Polkadot respectively) and dApps and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - An attack triggering the network not being able to confirm new transactions (Total network shutdown)\n  - An attack causing an unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (Network partition requiring hard fork)\n  - An attack causing direct loss of funds\n  - An attack causing permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)\n  - An attack causing the minting/creation of network utility tokens (MOVR/GLMR) outside of the normal, on-chain inflation mechanism\n  - Ability to execute system commands\n  - Extract Sensitive data/files from the server such as /etc/passwd\n  - Stealing User Cookies\n  - Signing transactions for other users\n  - Redirection of user deposits and withdrawals\n  - Subdomain takeover resulting in financial loss (applicable for subdomains with addresses published)\n  - Wallet interaction modification resulting in financial loss\n  - Direct theft of user funds \n  - Tampering with transactions submitted to the user’s wallet\n  - Submitting malicious transactions to an already-connected wallet",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. For smart contract bug reports, at the discretion of the team, a PoC may be required in order to determine if the bug exists, and if necessary, to calculate the extent of the damage the bug could have if exploited. \n\nThe payout for __critical vulnerabilities__ is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk and the combined __market cap__ (as listed on coinmarketcap on the day of the report) of the Moonbeam and Moonriver Blockchains. \n\nThis ratio is known as the __“risk ratio”__, i.e.:\n\nRisk Ratio = Funds at Risk / ( Moonbeam Market Cap + Moonriver Market Cap)\n\nThe exact payout is determined as follows:\n\n  - If the risk ratio is at or below 0.5, the payout is calculated linearly between 0$ and 250K.\n  - If the risk ratio is above 0.5, the payout is calculated linearly between $250K and $1M; with a maximum cap of $1M\n\nThis results in the following payout graph:\n![MoonbeamNEW](//images.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/1qjh15sfrhugcw7vcTgam4/6cef8abcb10e83f0d255bb2ed7337515/MoonbeamNEW)\n\nNote that a bug reported for one of either the Moonbeam or Moonriver networks that applies to both will be treated as a single report and paid only once. \n\nThe Moonbeam Foundation requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is an ID scan along with a selfie to verify identity. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Moonbeam Foundation__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__ or __USDC__.\n\nThe Moonriver parachain on Kusama and the Moonbeam parachain on Polkadot (estimated launch in Jan 2022) are both included in the assets-in-scope. \n\nAll source code of Moonbeam can be found at [https://github.com/PureStake/](https://github.com/PureStake/). However, only those in the Assets in Scope table are considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program.",
