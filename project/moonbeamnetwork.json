      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. For smart contract bug reports, at the discretion of the team, a PoC may be required in order to determine if the bug exists, and if necessary, to calculate the extent of the damage the bug could have if exploited. \n\nThe payout for __critical vulnerabilities__ is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk and the combined __market cap__ (as listed on coinmarketcap on the day of the report) of the Moonbeam and Moonriver Blockchains. \n\nThis ratio is known as the __“risk ratio”__, i.e.:\n\nRisk Ratio = Funds at Risk / ( Moonbeam Market Cap + Moonriver Market Cap)\n\nThe exact payout is determined as follows:\n\n  - If the risk ratio is at or below 0.5, the payout is calculated linearly between 0$ and 250K.\n  - If the risk ratio is above 0.5, the payout is calculated linearly between $250K and $1M; with a maximum cap of $1M\n\nThis results in the following payout graph:\n![MoonbeamNEW](//images.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/1qjh15sfrhugcw7vcTgam4/6cef8abcb10e83f0d255bb2ed7337515/MoonbeamNEW)\n\nNote that a bug reported for one of either the Moonbeam or Moonriver networks that applies to both will be treated as a single report and paid only once. \n\nThe Moonbeam Foundation requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is an ID scan along with a selfie to verify identity. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Moonbeam Foundation__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__ or __USDC__.\n\nThe Moonriver parachain on Kusama and the Moonbeam parachain on Polkadot (estimated launch in Jan 2022) are both included in the assets-in-scope. \n\nAll source code of Moonbeam can be found at [https://github.com/PureStake/](https://github.com/PureStake/).
