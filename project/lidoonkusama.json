That is possible because of an algorithm based on provable data and decentralized oracles. You can learn more [here](https://mixbytes.io/blog/lido-liquid-staking-for-kusama-upgrades-to-uncapped-second-stage).\n\nFor more information about Lido on Kusama, please visit [https://lido.fi/kusama](https://lido.fi/kusama).",
