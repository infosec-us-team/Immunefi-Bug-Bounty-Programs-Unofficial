The first Theta Vault will run a covered call strategy, which earns yield on a weekly basis through writing out of the money covered calls and collecting the premiums.\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the loss of user funds.\n\nFor more information about Aevo, please visit https://aevo.xyz",
