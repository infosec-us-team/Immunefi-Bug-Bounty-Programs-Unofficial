      "programOverview": "ZeroLiquid provides you self-repaying, 0% interest, non-liquidation loans for your liquid staking tokens.\n\nFor more information about ZeroLiquid, please visit [https://zeroliquid.xyz/ ](https://zeroliquid.xyz/) \n\nZeroLiquid provides rewards in ETH and ZERO, the native token of ZeroLiquid. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nZeroLiquid adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nZeroLiquid adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical \n- Smart Contract - High\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nZeroLiquid commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that ZeroLiquid will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nZeroLiquid has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 40 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- All vulnerabilities listed here:\n   - [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue++-label%3A%22G+%28Gas+Optimization%29%22+-label%3A%22QA+%28Quality+Assurance%29%22 (succinct)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue++-label%3A%22G+%28Gas+Optimization%29%22+-label%3A%22QA+%28Quality+Assurance%29%22)\n   - [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+ (full)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+)\n- All vulnerabilities listed in [Runtime Verification audit](https://github.com/runtimeverification/publications/blob/main/reports/smart-contracts/Alchemix_v2.pdf)\n- All vulnerabilities listed in [BlockApex audit](https://github.com/ZeroLiquid-xyz/zeroliquid-audit/blob/master/ZeroLiquid-BlockApex-Audit.pdf)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nZeroLiquid has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://github.com/ZeroLiquid-xyz/zeroliquid-audit/blob/master/ZeroLiquid-BlockApex-Audit.pdf](https://github.com/ZeroLiquid-xyz/zeroliquid-audit/blob/master/ZeroLiquid-BlockApex-Audit.pdf)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract + Critical + PoC Required\n- Smart Contract + High + PoC Required\n- Smart Contract + Medium + PoC Required\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\nThough only the proxy contracts are listed as in-scope, current implementation and any further updates to the implementation contracts are considered in scope. When reporting a bug, please make sure to select the relevant proxy smart contract as the target.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the ZeroLiquid team directly and are denominated in USD. The payment scheme involves two forms of currency: Ether (ETH) and ZeroLiquid Token (ZERO). 50% of the total payout is made in Ether, while the remaining 50% is made in ZeroLiquid Token.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n",
