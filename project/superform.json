  "programOverview": "The Superform Protocol is a suite of non-upgradeable, non-custodial smart contracts that act as a central repository for yield and a router for users.\n\nSuperform is a two-sided marketplace that enables efficient discovery, execution, and management of yield across chains. It is permissionless, modular, and enables intent-based transactions across chains.\n\nAt its core, Superform enables two novel experiences:\n\n  - Developers: Deploy your vault once. Permissionlessly list it on Superform. Access users on all chains.\n\n  - Yield Seekers: Deposit into any vault, on any chain, from any chain, using any token.\n\nFor more information about Superform, please visit [https://www.superform.xyz/](https://www.superform.xyz/)  and [https://docs.superform.xyz/](https://docs.superform.xyz/)\n\nSuperform provides rewards in __USDC__ on Ethereum, denominated in __USD__. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nSuperform will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n  - Full name \n  - Date of birth\n  - Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n  - Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nSuperform adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n  - Smart Contract - Critical\n  - Smart Contract - High\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n  - Anything in src/vendor & exploits concerning the inappropriate behavior of keeper roles, see [https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/tree/main/security-review](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/tree/main/security-review)\n  - Any bugs found from changes made to LiFiValidator and SocketValidator contracts after the program launch date are out of scope. \n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nSuperform’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/tree/main/security-review](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core/tree/main/security-review). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Superform has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 50000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n  - If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n  - For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to __10%__ of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n  - High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of __USD 1 000 to USD 5 000__ depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n  - In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Superform__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __USDC__ on Ethereum\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
