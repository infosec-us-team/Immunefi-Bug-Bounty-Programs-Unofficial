The protocol strives to create a vibrant borrowing and lending ecosystem around BTC the asset.    \n\nZest v2 introduces efficiency groups for granular risk pricing per asset combination, a hub-spoke architecture with market.clar as the central orchestrator, and collateral flexibility letting users choose between isolated (non-rehypothecated) or yield-bearing (rehypothecated) collateral based on their risk preferences.\n\nFor more information about Zest Protocol, please visit [zestprotocol.com](https://www.zestprotocol.com/).\n\nZest Protocol provides rewards in USDC/T on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nZest Protocol V2 adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nZest Protocol V2 adheres to Category 3: Approval Required. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our Responsible Publication page.",
