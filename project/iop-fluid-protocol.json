      "programOverview": "Fluid Protocol is an over-collateralized, decentralized borrowing platform specifically built for Fuel Network. Fluid provides users with a secure and efficient way to unlock liquidity from their collateral without selling their underlying assets, thereby enabling maximum capital efficiency.\n\nUSDF, the flagship product, is an over-collateralized native stablecoin soft-pegged to the US Dollar. By depositing collateral, borrowers can draw 0% interest-free loans, offering immediate liquidity while retaining ownership of their collateral—all without incurring interest charges or recurring fees. This battle-tested approach meets the demand within the Fuel community for a decentralized, stable unit of account.\n\nFor more information about Fluid Protocol, please visit [fluidprotocol.xyz](fluidprotocol.xyz)\n\nFluid Protocol GH repo: https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/fluid-protocol\n\nFluid Protocol provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD. \n\nThis Audit Competition is running on mainnet. The following conditions apply:\n\n1. Fluid team will freeze the codebase during the duration of the Audit Competition\n2. Duplicates are rewarded",

Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report. However, our team or program will designate it accordingly if applicable. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment and will always be rewarded. [View more information about Insights](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/13333032674961-Severity-Classification-System?utm_source=immunefi)\n\n\nPrivate known issues will unlock higher reward pools as though they were one severity level lower. For example, a Critical severity bug which was a private known issue would unlock the reward pool conditional on a High severity bug being found.\n\nThe severity level of private known issues remains unchanged and whitehats earn their portion of the reward pool and position on the leaderboard according to this unchanged severity level.\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3.",

      "assetsBodyV2": "__KYC Requirement__\n\nFluid Protocol will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers are required to submit KYC within 14 days of KYC being requested, else their rewards may be forfeited. Immunefi may make exceptions due to extenuating circumstances.\n\n__Asset Accuracy Assurance__\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n__Private Known Issues Reward Policy__\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward equal to that of a bug one severity lower.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nFluid protocol adheres to the Primacy of Impact for all severities listed.\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see Best Practices: Primacy of Impact \nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this audit competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Fluid Protocol has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\nThis is a rewrite of Liquity (v1) from Solidity into Sway, with numerous design changes. The main differences are the lack of recovery, multi-collateral system with single stability pool, and partial liquidations.\n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs? Useful aspects of this question are:__\n\nYes, please see required functions across all the contracts. Specifically in FPT staking, there are the same assumed invariants as in this report for Liquity: [https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProtocolandStabilityPoolFinalReport.pdf](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProtocolandStabilityPoolFinalReport.pdf)\nAdditionally, math rounding throughout the contracts, since we are using 9 decimals of precision whereas liquity is using 18. \n\n__What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?__\n\nSRC-20 Token Standard\n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nAn Owner is out of scope. \n\n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nOwner Address.\n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\n\nFuel standard library primarily. Sway libs. Pyth, Redstone. \n\n\n__Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse whitehats?__\n\nThe Fluid Proocol docs overview covers the main design changes from Liquity. There are some other minor changes that are not documented. \n\n__What is the test suite setup information?__\n\nThe tests for the smart contracts are included in the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/fluid-protocol](https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/fluid-protocol)\n\n**Test Structure:**\nUnit tests for some smart contracts are located in ./contracts/[contract-name]/src/utils.sw\nIntegration tests are located in <!-- ./contracts/[contract-name]/tests -->\nThe interfaces and setup for integration tests are in <!-- ./test-utils -->\n\n**Running the Tests:**\nMake sure you have fuelup, fuel-core, cargo, and rust installed\nUse command: make build-and-test\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nFluid Proocol’s completed audit reports can be found here [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhiI26aB9MTXfo-hLW8Qy9ki2ueCudKN/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhiI26aB9MTXfo-hLW8Qy9ki2ueCudKN/view?usp=sharing).
