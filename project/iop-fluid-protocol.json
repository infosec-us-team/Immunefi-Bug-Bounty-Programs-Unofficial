Fluid provides users with a secure and efficient way to unlock liquidity from their collateral without selling their underlying assets, thereby enabling maximum capital efficiency.\n\nUSDF, the flagship product, is an over-collateralized native stablecoin soft-pegged to the US Dollar. By depositing collateral, borrowers can draw 0% interest-free loans, offering immediate liquidity while retaining ownership of their collateral—all without incurring interest charges or recurring fees. This battle-tested approach meets the demand within the Fuel community for a decentralized, stable unit of account.\n\nFor more information about Fluid Protocol, please visit [fluidprotocol.xyz](fluidprotocol.xyz)\n\nFluid Protocol GH repo: https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/fluid-protocol\n\nFluid Protocol provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD. \n\nThis Audit Competition is running on mainnet. The following conditions apply:\n\n1. Fluid team will freeze the codebase during the duration of the Audit Competition\n2. Duplicates are rewarded",

Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report. However, our team or program will designate it accordingly if applicable. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment and will always be rewarded. [View more information about Insights](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/13333032674961-Severity-Classification-System?utm_source=immunefi)\n\n\nPrivate known issues will unlock higher reward pools as though they were one severity level lower. For example, a Critical severity bug which was a private known issue would unlock the reward pool conditional on a High severity bug being found.\n\nThe severity level of private known issues remains unchanged and whitehats earn their portion of the reward pool and position on the leaderboard according to this unchanged severity level.\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3.",

If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\nThis is a rewrite of Liquity (v1) from Solidity into Sway, with numerous design changes. The main differences are the lack of recovery, multi-collateral system with single stability pool, and partial liquidations.\n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs? Useful aspects of this question are:__\n\nYes, please see required functions across all the contracts. Specifically in FPT staking, there are the same assumed invariants as in this report for Liquity: [https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProtocolandStabilityPoolFinalReport.pdf](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProtocolandStabilityPoolFinalReport.pdf)\nAdditionally, math rounding throughout the contracts, since we are using 9 decimals of precision whereas liquity is using 18. \n\n__What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?__\n\nSRC-20 Token Standard\n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nAn Owner is out of scope. \n\n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nOwner Address.\n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\n\nFuel standard library primarily. Sway libs. Pyth, Redstone. \n\n\n__Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse whitehats?__\n\nThe Fluid Proocol docs overview covers the main design changes from Liquity. There are some other minor changes that are not documented. \n\n__What is the test suite setup information?__\n\nThe tests for the smart contracts are included in the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/fluid-protocol](https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/fluid-protocol)\n\n**Test Structure:**\nUnit tests for some smart contracts are located in ./contracts/[contract-name]/src/utils.sw\nIntegration tests are located in <!-- ./contracts/[contract-name]/tests -->\nThe interfaces and setup for integration tests are in <!-- ./test-utils -->\n\n**Running the Tests:**\nMake sure you have fuelup, fuel-core, cargo, and rust installed\nUse command: make build-and-test\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nFluid Proocol’s completed audit reports can be found here [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhiI26aB9MTXfo-hLW8Qy9ki2ueCudKN/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhiI26aB9MTXfo-hLW8Qy9ki2ueCudKN/view?usp=sharing).
