This program only covers the Algorand Blockchain itself - any third-party software or smart contracts built on the Algorand Blockchain are considered out of scope.\n\nAll Critical and High Blockchain/Digital Ledger Technology vulnerability reports require a Proof of Concept (‘PoC’) to be eligible for a reward.  Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the final decision of Immunefi, after consulting with the Algorand Inc. and the Algorand Foundation teams. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__. \nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Any issue on the issue tracker: [https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/issues](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/issues)\n  - Any issue found on open pull requests: [https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/pulls](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/pulls) \n\nPlease refer to the documentations here on creating a dev environment so that PoCs can be created properly.\n\n  - [https://developer.algorand.org/docs/](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/)\n  - [https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/)\n\nKYC shall be done for bug bounty hunters submitting a vulnerability report and requesting a reward for Critical and High Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities. The basic information needed is full name, residential address, and passport details (DOB, issuing country and passport number). Based on the basic information submitted, the Algorand Foundation team may request further information at its sole discretion for compliance with applicable laws.\n\nAdditionally, all levels of bug bounty hunters submitting a vulnerability report and requesting a reward need to submit certification that (i) they are not acting, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of any person, group entity, or nation named by any Executive Order or the United States Treasury Department as a terrorist, “Specially Designated National and Blocked Person,” or other banned or blocked person, entity, nation, or transaction pursuant to any law, order, rule or regulation that is enforced or administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control; and (ii) they are not engaging in, instigating or facilitating this transaction, directly or indirectly, on behalf of any such person, group, entity, or nation. They also need to submit an attestation that all information provided is true, correct, up-to-date and not misleading.\n\nThe collection of this information will be done by the Algorand Foundation team.\n\nBug bounty reward payouts are handled by the Algorand Foundation team directly and are denominated in __USDCa__.",
