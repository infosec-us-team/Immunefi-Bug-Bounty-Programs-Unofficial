Helio's destablecoin is called HAY, and it is over-collateralized with BNB tokens. To obtain HAY, the user will need to provide BNB collateral and borrow HAY against it. After that, HAY can be staked for long-term yield and transferred to other protocols to generate additional yield. HAY is over-collateralized, making its peg highly secure and comparable to the MakerDAO DAI token.\n\nFor more information about Helio, please visit [https://helio.money/](https://helio.money/).",

However, there is a minimum reward of USD 1,000 for each severity level, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Helio__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
