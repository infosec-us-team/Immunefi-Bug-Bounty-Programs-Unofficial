Aside from connecting blockchains and enabling a free flow of information, Router will also make smart order-routing possible, enabling users to swap their assets from different networks seamlessly.\n\nFor more information about Router, please visit [https://routerprotocol.com/](https://routerprotocol.com/). \n\nThe bug bounty program covers its smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Theft of governance funds \n  - Governance activity disruption\n  - Product App goes down\n  - Access to sensitive pages without authorization\n  - Economic Attacks of any kind",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be accepted. Additionally, all bug reports that are Medium or higher are required to include a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at __10%__ of economic damage, primarily taking into account the funds at risk. Other considerations such as PR and branding concerns may also be considered by the team at its discretion. However, the minimum reward amount is __USD 10 000__. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Router__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in __ETH__, __USDT__, or __ROUTE__, at the discretion of the team.",
