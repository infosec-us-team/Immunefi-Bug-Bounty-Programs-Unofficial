Aside from connecting blockchains and enabling a free flow of information, Router will also make smart order-routing possible, enabling users to swap their assets from different networks seamlessly.\n\nFor more information about Router, please visit [https://routerprotocol.com/](https://routerprotocol.com/). \n\nThe bug bounty program covers its smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Theft of governance funds \n  - Governance activity disruption\n  - Product App goes down\n  - Access to sensitive pages without authorization\n  - Economic Attacks of any kind",

Additionally, all bug reports that are Medium or higher are required to include a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at __10%__ of economic damage, primarily taking into account the funds at risk. Other considerations such as PR and branding concerns may also be considered by the team at its discretion. However, the minimum reward amount is __USD 10 000__. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Router__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

      "feasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
