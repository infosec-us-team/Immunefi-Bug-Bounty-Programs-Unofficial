This is the first open infrastructure allowing for the modularization of vaults using a protocol-endorsed VaultFactory that ensures the safety of the strategy and its contracts. Vaults can interact with a variety of protocols through the ERC4626-Wrapper and are also stackable in design, meaning you can stack on top of other vaults. \n\nFor more information about VaultCraft, please visit [https://www.vaultcraft.io/](https://www.vaultcraft.io/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Temporary freezing of funds\n  - Unable to call contract\n  - Gas drainage / freezing of funds caused by gas overflow\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nCritical and high vulnerabilities are further capped at __10%__ of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 25 000__ for Critical bug reports, and __USD 1 000__ for high severity bug reports.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __VaultCraft__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
