SPOT can fulfill many properties of modern day stablecoins but is not pegged to any particular value.

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __SPOT__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
