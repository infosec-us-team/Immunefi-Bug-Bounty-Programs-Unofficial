      "programOverview": "The Nodle Network is a decentralized wireless network, composed of Nodle Edge Nodes, powered by the Nodle Chain, and the NODL token.\n\nNodle connects the physical world to Web3 by using smartphones as edge nodes. The edge nodes read devices and sensors in the physical world using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and connect that information to the blockchain. Creating a geolocation-based layer one that can be used by many unique applications built for the hyper-connected, mobile-oriented world we live in. Nodle creates an economic model that is secure, private, and scalable.\n\nNodle also develops the Click Camera, a unique solution to authenticate pictures using C2PA, a standard from Adobe, and NFTs.\n\nFor more information about Nodle, please visit [https://www.nodle.com/ ](https://www.nodle.com/) \nFor more information about Click, please visit [https://clickapp.com/](https://clickapp.com/)\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)\n\n__KYC Requirements__\nNodle will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- ID scan\n- Self portrait\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a vulnerability report.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nNodle adheres to category Publication **Category 3: Approval Required**. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted vulnerabilities. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication]() page.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nNodle adheres to the Primacy of Impact, which means the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \nNodle  adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nNodle commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Nodle will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn scenarios where there might be a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBitswift has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",

      "rewardsBody": "Please review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nRewards for critical Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of the funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.  However, there is a minimum reward of USD 10 000 for Critical Blockchain/DLT bug reports.\n\nRewards for high Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are further capped at 100% of the funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.  However, there is a minimum reward of USD 2 000 for High Blockchain/DLT bug reports.\n\nRewards for critical web/app vulnerabilities will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 4 000.\n\nHigh web/app vulnerabilities will be further capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 1 000.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Nodle team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in NODL, and will be converted to a USD value at the time of bounty acceptance. Nodle commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements__\n\nNodle __does__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bounty payouts. \n\nKYC Info Required:\n- ID Scan\n- Self Portrait\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a vulnerability report.   \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nVulnerability reports covering previously-discovered are not eligible for any reward through this bounty program.
