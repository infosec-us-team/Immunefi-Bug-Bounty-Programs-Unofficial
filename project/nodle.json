The edge nodes read devices and sensors in the physical world using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and connect that information to the blockchain. Creating a geolocation-based layer one that can be used by many unique applications built for the hyper-connected, mobile-oriented world we live in. Nodle creates an economic model that is secure, private, and scalable.\n\nFor more information about Nodle, please visit [https://www.nodle.com/ ](https://www.nodle.com/) \n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nNodle adheres to category Publication Category 3: Approval Required.

This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nRewards for critical Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of the funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.  However, there is a minimum reward of USD 10 000 for Critical Blockchain/DLT bug reports.\n\nRewards for high Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are further capped at 100% of the funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.  However, there is a minimum reward of USD 2 000 for High Blockchain/DLT bug reports.\n\nRewards for critical web/app vulnerabilities will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 4 000.\n\nHigh web/app vulnerabilities will be further capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 1 000.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Nodle team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in NODL, and will be converted to a USD value at the time of bounty acceptance. Nodle commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements__\n\nNodle __does__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bounty payouts. \n\nKYC Info Required:\n- ID Scan\n- Self Portrait\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a vulnerability report.   \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nVulnerability reports covering previously-discovered are not eligible for any reward through this bounty program. If a report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the vulnerability report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n\n- Upstream reports to[ Parity Technologies](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues?q=label%3AI2-security), for Polkadot or related projects\n(Blockchain/DLT/Web/API)\n- Upstream reports made to [OnFinality](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/onfinality-vulnerability-and-bug-reporting), concerning improper operation of the Nodle hosted Mainnet RPC endpoint (Blockchain/DLT/Web/API)\n- [Substrate Pallet Audit, Halborn, Feb. 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p9MEqpqxUPNflOUSI0qw-c7wZ4CbWiBp/view) (Blockchain/DLT)\n- [Secfault Security, Substrate Chain Audit, July 2020 ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POiYpYuh0iQ669K-3y4jn_LoTJ4Ge52N/view)(Blockchain/DLT)\n- [Quantstamp Security Assessment Certificate, Sept. 2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1niLWDIE26ZLNdjHLiLgOxvw5HV0CQwpv/view) (Blockchain/DLT)\n",
