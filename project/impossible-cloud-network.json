      "programOverview": "Impossible Cloud Network (ICN) is developing the foundational layer for the next-gen internet. Challenging the dominance of centralized tech giants, ICN introduces a fully open, multi-service, permissionless and composable cloud infrastructure that integrates storage, compute, and networking at scale. Our enterprise-grade, decentralized architecture ensures high performance, security, and censorship resistance – making web3 as seamless as web2. With real-world adoption and a pragmatic approach to decentralization, ICN is positioned to become the foundation of a future internet, powering the next generation of cloud services, AI agents, enterprise software, and digital ecosystems.\n\nUnlimited Scale: AI and cloud demand cannot be met. Traditional cloud is hitting scalability limits, preventing dynamic expansion and restricting new entrants. The internet needs infrastructure that can adapt to an evolving digital era.\n\nUnrestricted Cloud: Most of the internet is controlled by a handful of large players, limiting opportunities for individuals and businesses to participate in AI and cloud growth. Web3 offers greater trustlessness, data authenticity, and accessibility with ICNs performance and efficiency.\n\nNetworks without demand: Many Web3 companies are bootstrapping networks without a viable path to profitability. ICN introduces a decentralized, market-driven approach that enables sustainable growth and economic opportunity with a network that dynamically shifts with the ecosystem.\nICN decentralizes cloud infrastructure by bringing together a global network of Hardware Providers (HPs) and Builders in a transparent and open ecosystem with a deeply enabled crypto-native core. This model allows protocols and businesses to access top-tier computing power and storage capacity without the limitations of traditional cloud services—ensuring scalable, secure, and performant solutions while maintaining composability and trust optionality for a truly modular network layer.\n\n\nFor more information about Impossible Cloud Network, please visit https://www.icn.global/\n\nImpossible Cloud Network provides rewards in USDC on Base, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\nThe assessment of the extent of any potential indirect economic damage, defined as damage other than that evidenced by a PoC that showcases the direct exploitation of the vulnerability leading to impact, is at the full discretion of the project.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "_blank_",
      "rewardsBody": "__Rewards by Threat Level__\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. \nReward Calculation for Critical Level Reports\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 25 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. \nThe amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at 100% and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 1h the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down\nReward Calculation for High Level Reports\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 3 000 to USD 5 000 with the reward calculated based on 100% of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward.\n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. \n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nImpossible Cloud Network adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page.\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.\n\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk.\n\n\nIntended functionality:\n\n- Temporary freezing of funds: The ICN Protocol has implemented a pause feature which stops funds from being able to transit through the protocol. Meaning ICNT cannot be deposited or withdrawn until unpaused. This is used only in critical scenarios of catastrophic bugs that may jeopardize user funds or protocol economies to minimize damage and give time for the team to issue fixes.\n\n- Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds: Protocol rewards are funded by a smart contract that rewards activity via a reward fund. As the reward fund depletes, the ICN protocol will be topped up to maintain healthy operation. While there is no protocol rule to prevent the reward fund from depleting completely, ICN is regularly maintaining checks and periodically returns the fund to healthy levels.\n\n- Scenarios that involve unsupported states or rely on assumptions (such as transferring an NFT while staked, etc) are not considered valid and will be rejected. \n\nKnown issues:\n\n- ScalerNode can be removed before its utilized capacity is reset: Users can create bookings for resources on ScalerNodes. The BookingManager is responsible for updating the utilized capacity trackers for the region, cluster and hardware provider for the node that's being booked/re-booked. As a booking expires the updates to these trackers are not updated immediately, instead a call to expireCapacity() needs to be made which will perform the desired operations. Currently a node can be removed by a call to removeScalerNode() on ICNRegistry which does not check whether the capacity for the node is still marked as utilized. After removing the node it will be impossible to revert the utilized capacity updates that were made in creating the last booking for the removed node. As a result various computations around protocol rewards will be inaccurate since they'll operate with inaccurate utilized capacity numbers.\n\n- Users are not guarded against price increase in the extendBooking path: Users are guarded against unexpected price increases in the bookCapacity function by specifying a maxBookingPrice. But this guard is not present in the extendBooking function where similar similar issue can occur.\n\n- Link token ids must be smaller than the max uint32 value: The modules supporting link staking and reward claiming assume that link token ids have a value lower than the max uint32 value.Currently the ICN link contract supports minting tokens that do not satisfy this constraint, as a result governance might accidentally mint tokens that are incompatible with the modules.\n\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Impossible Cloud Network team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC  on Base.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
