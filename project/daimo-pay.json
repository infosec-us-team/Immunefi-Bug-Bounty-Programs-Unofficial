  "assetsBodyV2": "*Important notes for hackers:*\n\n### Assume a smart relayer\n\nAs in all intent-based protocols, the relayer must validate intents before solving. \"If you fast-finish a malformed intent, you might not get paid back\" is not a bug but as-designed.\n\nOur intents are designed such that `bridgeTokenOutOptions` are meant to be interchangeable alternatives, such as (100 USDC, 100 USDT). Meanwhile, `finalTokenOut` should also be a roughly equal value, say (100 DAI). They are primarily built to be used with stablecoins.\n\nIf an attacker creates an intent address with `finalTokenOut` of $100, but (at least one of) `bridgeTokenOutOptions` is worth less than that, then no solver will fast-finish such an intent, because they are not guaranteed full repayment. This is not a bug.\n\n### Assume valid usage\n\nThe intent protocol ensures, first and foremost, that a user who creates an Intent Address and sends funds to it will either A. see their intent completed, or B. received a full refund. It cannot guarantee that misuse will not result in loss of funds.\n\nIn particular, *overpaying* an intent can result in loss. If Alice makes an ntent address to send $100 to Bob on Base, but then she sends $150 to it on Arbitrum, a solver can complete the intent and keep the extra $50. This is analagous to setting a too-high slippage tolerance in Uniswap, or a too-high tip in other intent protocols. It is known behavior, not a bug.\n\n\n### Focus on loss of funds\n\nThe scenarios we're particularly interested in are ones where:\n- **A user uses the system as intended, but loses funds.** These are Critical, see Rewards.\n- **A well-implemented relayer does everything right, but still loses funds.** These are High, see Rewards.\n- **A malicious relayer can temporarily freeze or otherwise grief users, or vice versa.**",

  "rewardsBody": "__Rewards by Threat Level__\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\n- For critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 20 000.. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward.\n- The amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at 100% and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every [300 blocks] the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High impacts concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 2500 to USD 7500. with the reward calculated based on 100% of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward.\n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional expirationTimestamp for a given Daimo Pay intent, that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward.\n\nThe assets in scope for this bounty are specifically our Daimo Pay smart contracts.\n\nNot in scope:\n* Web app/SDK/JS issues. We are listing the test page (htts://pay.daimo.com/demo/tests) only as an aid for researchers to test and understand our contracts more quickly, not because we are looking for bugs in the test page itself.\n\nSpecial case:\n* 'DaimoPayRelayer'. This is an untrusted contract. Any issues that result in loss of *user* funds will be treated as critical, while issues resulting in loss of our own *company* funds in DaimoPayRelayer will be treated has high severity but not critical.",
