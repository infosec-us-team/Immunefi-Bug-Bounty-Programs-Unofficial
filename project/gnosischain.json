Secured by over 165k validators around the world, Gnosis Chain has all the tooling you are used to and trust-minimized bridges to mainnet.\n\nFor more information about Gnosis Chain, please visit [https://www.gnosis.io/](https://www.gnosis.io/).\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on the bridges smart contracts that move assets in between Mainnet and Gnosis chain. The xDai bridge is used to bridge DAI on mainnet and the native xDai coin on Gnosis chain. For more information see [https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/tokenbridge/xdai-bridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/tokenbridge/xdai-bridge). The OmniBridge is a native token bridge that mints the canonical representation of bridged assets on Gnosis.
