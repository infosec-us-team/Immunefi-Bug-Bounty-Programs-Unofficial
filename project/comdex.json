      "programOverview": "Comdex is a DeFi Infrastructure Layer for the Cosmos Ecosystem. It provides a variety of interoperable plug & play modules for projects to use to create their own DeFi platforms providing utility to the Cosmos community as well.\n\nOur goal is to democratize finance by building an infrastructure layer optimized for aggregating cross-chain liquidity with a suite of cutting-edge DeFi products. The primary means of doing this is by providing modules built on the core primitives of finance, allowing builders to utilize them to launch DeFi applications.\n\nAs of now, The Comdex Ecosystem comprises of:\n- Composite $CMST : crypto collateralized stablecoin, mintable through Harbor Protocol.\n- Harbor Protocol: an interchain stablecoin protocol that enables the minting of the CMST stablecoin using various interchain assets as collateral.\n- cSwap: a decentralized, IBC-enabled hybrid exchange combining both traditional AMM-based liquidity pools alongside an order book-based system\n- Commodo: a decentralized, open-source, IBC-native, collateralized lending-borrowing platform on Cosmos\n\nFor more information about Comdex, please visit \n\n- [https://comdex.one/](https://comdex.one/)\n- [https://docs.comdex.one](https://docs.comdex.one)\n- [http://docs.harborprotocol.one](http://docs.harborprotocol.one)\n- [http://docs.cswap.one](http://docs.cswap.one)\n- [https://docs.commodo.one](https://docs.commodo.one)\n\nTo set up local chain with all the apps do follow this instructions : [https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex/tree/development/scripts/comdex_local_setup](https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex/tree/development/scripts/comdex_local_setup)\nAbove script will spin local network with all the initial setups of harbor, cswap and commodo protocol.\n",

All Medium, High and Critical Blockchain/DLT/Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. All Medium, High and Critical Web/app bug reports also require a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward.

In the event that multiple bug reports are submitted that exceed this amount, the rewards will be provided on a first come first served basis. All remaining valid reports will have their rewards considered after the launch of the project.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Comdex__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
