      "programOverview": "Sturdy is a new kind of DeFi lending protocol that enables users to earn high stablecoin yields or take out interest-free loans. Lenders deposit assets they'd like to earn yield on while borrowers provide collateral and take out the assets deposited by lenders as a loan. \n\nOn existing lending protocols, the interest earned by lenders comes from borrowers. So in order for lenders to earn more, borrowers must pay more. Sturdy uses a different model, where yield instead comes from the borrowers' collateral. When borrowers provide a token as collateral, Sturdy converts it into an interest-bearing token (ibToken) using protocols like Yearn or Lido. Over time, these ibTokens accrue yield; the yield from these tokens are then distributed to lenders in the same token they deposited. \n\nSturdy enables stablecoin lenders to access yields that are normally only accessible by holding and staking volatile assets and powers interest-free loans for borrowers.\n\nFor more information about Sturdy, please visit [https://sturdy.finance](https://sturdy.finance/) and [https://github.com/sturdyfi/sturdy-contracts](https://github.com/sturdyfi/sturdy-contracts).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Any governance voting result manipulation\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Extract Sensitive data/files from the server such as /etc/passwd\n  - Taking Down the application/website\n  - Wallet interaction modification resulting in financial loss\n  - Redirection of user deposits and withdrawals",
