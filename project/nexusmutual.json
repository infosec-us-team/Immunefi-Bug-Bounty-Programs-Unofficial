      "programOverview": "Nexus Mutual is a cutting-edge decentralized insurance alternative that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as a groundbreaking community-led protocol that offers transparent and flexible options for its members to buy cover, underwrite risk, assess claims, and build risk management businesses.\n\nWith a primary focus on securing smart contracts and protecting against economic attacks, Nexus Mutual provides safeguards for both the capital pool and user funds. This ensures that members have peace of mind and confidence in the platform's security measures, as well as accessibility and user action security.\n\nFor more information about Nexus Mutual, please visit [nexusmutual.io](http://nexusmutual.io) \n\nNexus Mutual provides rewards in __USDC__, denominated in __USD__. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nNexus Mutual adheres to category __3 - Approval Required__. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nNexus Mutual adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n  - Smart Contract – Critical\n    - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n   - Permanent freezing of funds\n   - Protocol insolvency\n\n  - Smart Contract – High\n    - Theft of unclaimed yield\n    - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n    - Temporary freezing of funds\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nNexus Mutual commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Nexus Mutual will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAll Nexus Mutual security audits can be accessed on: [https://docs.nexusmutual.io/overview/resources/audits-and-security](https://docs.nexusmutual.io/overview/resources/audits-and-security). Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Nexus Mutual has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-).\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 50 000__.  The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. A minimum reward of __USD 25 000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n  - If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded/paused/killed, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading, pausing, or in some cases, killing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n  - For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that can not be upgraded/paused/killed, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n  - High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.   \n\n  - In the event of temporary freezing, the reward increases at a multiplier of two from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by __Nexus Mutual__ directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. \n",
