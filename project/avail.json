      "programOverview": "Avail is designed to be a platform that connects different ecosystems by providing a modular, scalable, and interoperable platform.\nAvail's vision is to provide a cohesive, unified user experience within a flexible and modular blockchain ecosystem, drawing on lessons from Web2 to innovate in Web3. Avail is not just building a product; we are pioneering a new category in the blockchain space, paving the way for an era of enhanced scalability and seamless integration.\n\n\nAvail aims to provide a cohesive platform that bridges the gaps between various blockchain ecosystems.\nBy implementing the right primitives and standards, Avail seeks to ensure interoperability and cooperation among diverse blockchain networks. This approach not only enhances the user experience but also fosters a more integrated and efficient blockchain ecosystem.\nWith Avail's foundational DA layer, different ecosystems can innovate on top freely, while leveraging Nexus for cross-ecosystem messaging.\nFor more information about Avail, please visit https://www.availproject.org/\n\nAvail provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nAvail will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAvail adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following levels:\n\n- Blockchain/DLT - Critical\n- Blockchain/DLT - High\n- Blockchain/DLT - Medium\n- Blockchain/DLT - Low\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Smart Contract - Low\n- Web/App - Critical\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see Best Practices: [Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAvail’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/availproject/audits](https://github.com/availproject/audits). Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Avail has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Avail’s codebase can be found at [https://github.com/availproject](https://github.com/availproject). \n\nDocumentation and further resources can be found on [https://docs.availproject.org/docs/introduction-to-avail](https://docs.availproject.org/docs/introduction-to-avail).",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward USD 250,000. However, a minimum reward of USD 50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a  non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown) - USD 50,000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork) - USD 50,000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork) - USD 50,000\n\nFor high Blockchain/DLT non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Unintended chain split (network partition) - USD 20,000\n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments - USD 20,000\n- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters - USD 20,000\n- RPC API crash affecting projects with greater than or equal to 25% of the market capitalization on top of the respective layer - USD 20,000\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 500,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\nFor critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 5,000 to USD 20,000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional [24h] that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\nFor critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with USD 20,000, only if the impact leads to:\nA loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\nPrivate key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of USD 6,000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Avail team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
