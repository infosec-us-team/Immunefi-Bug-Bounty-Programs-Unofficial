Its current functionality scope includes low gas transfers of ETH and ERC20 tokens, atomic swaps & limit orders as well as native L2 NFT support. \n\nZKsync Lite is built on ZK Rollup architecture. ZK Rollup is an L2 scaling solution in which all funds are held by a smart contract on the mainchain, while computation and storage are performed off-chain. For every Rollup block, a state transition zero-knowledge proof (SNARK) is generated and verified by the mainchain contract. This SNARK includes the proof of the validity of every single transaction in the Rollup block. Additionally, the public data update for every block is published over the mainchain network as cheap calldata.\n\nFor more information about ZKsync Lite, please visit [https://zksync.io/](https://zksync.io/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts, ZK-SNARK circuits, web and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds by permanent freezing or direct theft\n  - Temporary freezing of funds\n  - Smart contract destruction\n  - Double spending\n  - Ability to execute a transaction with changed signed parameters",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. For the ZK-SNARK Circuits, the classification will be based on the impacts listed on the Impacts in Scope section below\n\nAll critical and high severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nThe rewards for the Blockchain/DLT section is only for the ZK-SNARK Circuits assets and not any other blockchain/DLT section. The maximum bounty is reserved for the most severe, highest-likelihood cases - e.g., immediate fund theft under normal operation, without reliance on operator keys and without inducing Exodus Mode. For other cases, reward will be set within the bounty range, guided by the report’s impact and practical likelihood. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\n__KYC__\n\nZKsync has a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. Government identification is required for the KYC process.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __ZKsync__ Lite team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ via ZKsync Era.",

  "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
