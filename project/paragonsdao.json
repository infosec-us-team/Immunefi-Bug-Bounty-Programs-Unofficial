For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nParagonsDAO understands the nature of the industry and wants to preserve privacy where possible. The provision of KYC is required to receive a reward of over USD 15,000 for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n- National ID \n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nParagonsDAO adheres to category 2 : Notice required. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nParagonsDAO adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nParagonsDAO commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that ParagonsDAO will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n",
