  "programOverview": "Extra Finance is a professional leveraged yield farming (LYF) protocol:\n\n__Leveraged Yield Farming (LYF):__\n\nBy offering up to 7x leverage, Extra Finance enables users to farm a diverse range of farming pools with customized farming strategies. Extra Finance also functions as a lending protocol, users can deposit funds to earn lending interest.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is excited to announce its latest bug bounty matching program, specifically designed for Extra Finance. In collaboration with Immunefi, the Optimism Foundation aims to encourage and incentivize security researchers to find and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. This will contribute to a safer ecosystem for all Optimism participants involved and showcase the foundation's commitment to security. \n\nTo participate, security researchers should focus on identifying critical and high Extra Finance-specific vulnerabilities that could potentially impact the wider Optimism ecosystem. Optimism will match any rewards offered by Extra Finance, contributing a total of 52,500 OP tokens.\n\nFor more information about Extra Finance, please visit [https://extrafi.io/](https://extrafi.io/) \n\nExtra Finance provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Lending Market:__\n\nExtrafi Xlend is a smart lending protocol offering features such as multi-accounts and liquidation-free borrowing. Its integrated smart accounts unlock advanced on-chain lending and borrowing strategies.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nExtra Finance adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nExtra Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 15 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.  \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nExtra Finance has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n__LYF:__\n\n- [https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-ExtraFi-v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-ExtraFi-v1.0.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/blocksecteam/audit-reports/blob/main/solidity/blocksec_extrafinance_v1.0-signed.pdf ](https://github.com/blocksecteam/audit-reports/blob/main/solidity/blocksec_extrafinance_v1.0-signed.pdf) \n\n__Lending Market:__\n\n- [https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-ExtraFi-v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-ExtraFi-v1.0.pdf)\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nAs part of the bug bounty matching program, Optimism will contribute __52,500__ OP tokens to match the rewards offered by Extra Finance. This means that for every reward paid out by Extra Finance to a security researcher, Optimism will provide an additional, matching reward, in OP tokens. The total reward pool for this program is __52,500__ OP tokens.\n\nPayouts are handled by the Extra Finance team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.",
