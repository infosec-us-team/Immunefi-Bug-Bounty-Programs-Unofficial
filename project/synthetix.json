      "programOverview": "Synthetix provides a building layer that allows other protocols to tap into its universal liquidity pool, offering derivative exposure on an EVM compatible chain.\n\nTo be able to offer Synths & Perps trading, Synthetix needs accurate and up-to-date price data for the underlying assets. Synthetix utilizes both Chainlink and the Pyth oracle networks, which provide price information into smart contracts.\n\nResources regarding Synthetix contracts can be found on the [documentation](https://docs.synthetix.io/synthetix-protocol/welcome-to-synthetix) site, where v2x and v3 can be toggled. Both versions are included in the scope of this bug bounty program.\n\nFor more information about Synthetix, please visit [https://synthetix.io/](https://synthetix.io/).\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is excited to announce its latest bug bounty matching program, specifically designed for Synthetix. In collaboration with Immunefi, the Optimism Foundation aims to encourage and incentivize security researchers to find and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. This will contribute to a safer ecosystem for all Optimism participants involved and showcase the foundation's commitment to security. \n\nTo participate, security researchers should focus on identifying critical and high Synthetix-specific vulnerabilities that could potentially impact the wider Optimism ecosystem. Optimism will match any rewards offered by Synthetix, contributing a total of __52,500 OP tokens__. Please note that OP matching payouts are subject to the total amount of OP tokens left and the price of the OP token on the day of report submission.\n\nSynthetix provides rewards in __USDC__. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nSynthetix adheres to the Primacy of Rules\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nSynthetix has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the\nfollowing types:\n\n**Smart Contracts/Blockchain:**\n\n- Re-entrancy\n- Logic errors\n  - including user authentication errors\n- Solidity/EVM details not considered\n  - including integer over-/under-flow\n  - including unhandled exceptions\n- Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - including composability vulnerabilities\n- Oracle failure/manipulation\n- Novel governance attacks\n- Economic/financial attacks\n  - including flash loan attacks\n- Congestion and scalability\n  - including running out of gas\n  - including block stuffing\n  - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n- Consensus failures\n- Cryptography problems\n  - Signature malleability\n  - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n  - Weak randomness\n  - Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD $100,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD $10,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \nFor critical web/app bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD $30,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD $1,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of smart contract vulnerabilities whereby the attacks can be repeated at certain time intervals, if the attack can be stopped by a configuration change, the total value-at-risk from the consecutive attacks is computed by adding up the losses incurred and applying the below discount factors:\n\n| Time Since Attack 1     | Discount Factor     |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| 0 to 15 minutes       | 0%       |\n| 15 to 30 minutes       | 25%       |\n| 30 to 60 minutes       | 50%       |\n| 60 to 120 minutes       | 75%       |\n| > 120 minutes       | 100%       |\n\nIf the attack cannot be stopped by configuration changes, the discount factors are adjusted by 50% (i.e. 0% / 12.5% / 25% … ), with the terminal discount factor being 100% at 4 hours (from the initial attack).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nSynthetix has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n  - [https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-docs/blob/master/content/releases.md](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-docs/blob/master/content/releases.md)\n  -[ https://docs.synthetix.io/v/v3/for-developers/smart-contract-audits](https://docs.synthetix.io/v/v3/for-developers/smart-contract-audits)\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nBug reports that involve one or more other protocols (e.g. utilising flash loans from a margin protocol or manipulating the spot prices on a DEX), either to make an attack more severe than it would be in isolation, or to achieve an attack that would otherwise be impossible or infeasible, would be out-of-scope. However, they will be considered within scope and categorised according to the program rules as long as all of the following are true:\n\n  - Losses or other negative effects of the attack are inflicted on users who provide liquidity (whether for staking or trading) directly on contracts managed by Synthetix (i.e. vulnerabilities on the greater Synthetix Ecosystem partners and integrators are out of scope).\n  - The losses or other negative effects could be prevented via changes to contracts that can be updated or modified.\n\nIn case an attack requires use of attackers’ own funds (in order to perform/execute a trade), and requires the attacker taking on economic or financial risk, then a discount is applied on the value-at risk based on the likelihood of an attack succeeding. The likelihood should be estimated by reference to reasonable assessment of the environment at the time of the bug bounty submission or by reference to the PoC. Synthetix has ultimate discretion in providing their opinion on the discount used and the eligibility of such disclosures to be considered within scope of the bounty program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n  - Critical\n  - High\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nAs part of the bug bounty matching program, Optimism will contribute __52,500 OP__ tokens to match the rewards offered by Synthetix. This means that for every reward paid out by Synthetix to a security researcher, Optimism will provide an additional, matching reward, in OP tokens. The total reward pool for this program is __52,500 OP tokens__. The other 50% of the reward (if applicable for matching) will be paid by __Synthetix__ in __USDC__. \n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System v. 2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). This is a simplified 4-level scale. The development of this scale took into consideration multiple factors that may affect a vulnerability and its likelihood of exploitation, but finalizes them largely by the impact that they cause.\n\nThe table below is mostly concerned with the consequence of a successful exploit. Keep in mind that if the exploit requires elevated privileges or uncommon user interaction, the level of the bug may be downgraded to reflect that or rejected. \n\n__Goodwill Payments__ \n\nThis applies to the following severity and asset levels: \n  - Smart Contract - Low\n  - Web/App - Medium\n  - Web/App - Low\n\nSynthetix is willing to offer discretionary “Goodwill Payments” for any bugs that fall under these categories and affect __TVL <$1,000__, \n\nFurthermore, if the value of the assets at risk cannot be estimated, then the bounty payment would be discretionary based on goodwill terms.",
