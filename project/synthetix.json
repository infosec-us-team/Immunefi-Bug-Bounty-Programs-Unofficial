All other v3 contracts that are not related to snx/susd staking,  as well spot markets on v2x are not covered in this bounty program\n\nFor more information about Synthetix, please visit [https://synthetix.io/](https://synthetix.io/).\n\n\nSynthetix provides rewards in __USDC__. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nSynthetix adheres to the Primacy of Rules\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nSynthetix has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD $100,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD $10,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \nFor critical web/app bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD $30,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD $1,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of smart contract vulnerabilities whereby the attacks can be repeated at certain time intervals, if the attack can be stopped by a configuration change, the total value-at-risk from the consecutive attacks is computed by adding up the losses incurred and applying the below discount factors:\n\n| Time Since Attack 1     | Discount Factor     |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| 0 to 15 minutes       | 0%       |\n| 15 to 30 minutes       | 25%       |\n| 30 to 60 minutes       | 50%       |\n| 60 to 120 minutes       | 75%       |\n| > 120 minutes       | 100%       |\n\nIf the attack cannot be stopped by configuration changes, the discount factors are adjusted by 50% (i.e. 0% / 12.5% / 25% … ), with the terminal discount factor being 100% at 4 hours (from the initial attack).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nSynthetix has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n  - [https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-docs/blob/master/content/releases.md](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-docs/blob/master/content/releases.md)\n  -[ https://docs.synthetix.io/v/v3/for-developers/smart-contract-audits](https://docs.synthetix.io/v/v3/for-developers/smart-contract-audits)\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n  - Critical\n  - High\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nAs part of the bug bounty matching program, Optimism will contribute __52,500 OP__ tokens to match the rewards offered by Synthetix. This means that for every reward paid out by Synthetix to a security researcher, Optimism will provide an additional, matching reward, in OP tokens. The total reward pool for this program is __52,500 OP tokens__. The other 50% of the reward (if applicable for matching) will be paid by __Synthetix__ in __USDC__. \n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System v. 2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). This is a simplified 4-level scale. The development of this scale took into consideration multiple factors that may affect a vulnerability and its likelihood of exploitation, but finalizes them largely by the impact that they cause.\n\nThe table below is mostly concerned with the consequence of a successful exploit. Keep in mind that if the exploit requires elevated privileges or uncommon user interaction, the level of the bug may be downgraded to reflect that or rejected. \n\n__Goodwill Payments__ \n\nThis applies to the following severity and asset levels: \n  - Smart Contract - Low\n  - Web/App - Medium\n  - Web/App - Low\n\nSynthetix is willing to offer discretionary “Goodwill Payments” for any bugs that fall under these categories and affect __TVL <$1,000__, \n\nFurthermore, if the value of the assets at risk cannot be estimated, then the bounty payment would be discretionary based on goodwill terms.",

      "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
      "customOutOfScopeInformation": " - Attacks that require altering the configurations of the protocol from the time the vulnerability disclosure is submitted (i.e. listing new assets / changing parameters). However, changes in configuration that are staged to be implemented and have been voted on by [governance](https://sips.synthetix.io/) are considered to be in scope.\n  - Security researchers from restricted countries, reference to the [terms](https://staking.synthetix.io/terms/), are not eligible for bounties regardless of the scope of the vulnerability disclosure\n  - Activities that violate the whitehat [rules of engagement](https://immunefi.com/rules/) would result in revocation of the bounty regardless of the disclosure merit.",
