Injective is incubated by Binance and is backed by prominent investors such as Jump Crypto, Pantera and Mark Cuban.\n\nFor more information about Injective, please visit https://injective.com/\n\nInjective provides rewards in stablecoins, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nInjective adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Blockchain/DLT : Critical\n- Smart Contract : Critical\n- Web/App : Critical\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under \nPrimacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- Vulnerabilities found in vendor systems such as Cosmos-SDK, IBC, CometBFT and CosmWasm fall outside this policy and should be reported to the respective vendor following their disclosure policy (if any)",

      "rewardsBody": "__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward [$500,000].\n\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $500,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. \n\nFor critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with [$50,000], only if the impact leads to:\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. \nThe amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at **100%** and then a reduction of **25%** from the amount of the first attack for every 1h  the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down\n\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High impacts concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield are rewarded within a range of [$25,000] to [$100,000] with the reward calculated based on **100%** of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward.  \n  - If the duration of temporary freezing is 1h or less, then the severity level will be reduced to Medium if the amount is equal to or greater than USD 25  000. If not, the severity level will be downgraded to Low.\n  - There needs to be a minimum of USD 10 000 at risk in order for a report to be considered High.\n\n\n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward.\n\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\nPayouts are handled by the Injective team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in Stablecoins.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
