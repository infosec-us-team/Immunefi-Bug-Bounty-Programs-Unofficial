Built by Aptos-backed Pontem, it has feature parity with both Uniswap and Curve using various bonding curves to enable liquidity providers and traders to swap assets.

Token economic is audit coming soon.\n\nFor more information about Liquidswap, please visit [https://pontem.network/liquidswap](https://pontem.network/liquidswap).",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. \nAll bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 30 000__ and a maximum reward of __USD 500 000__.\n\nThe Liquidswap team requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a Critical severity report and wanting a reward. The information needed is a National ID photo along with a utility bill for proof of residency.\n\nKnown issues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [OtterSec - Website](https://1969469778-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F7hOyaMi2Pz1hDJkk7WIF%2Fuploads%2FmvEWDi25tfOGjACf57ga%2Fpontem-liquidswap-ottersec-audit.pdf?alt=media&token=494969dd-10e2-42f9-91b3-00c1d51f7560) \n  - [Halborn - General](https://1969469778-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F7hOyaMi2Pz1hDJkk7WIF%2Fuploads%2Fgu3YmcQ9v62UveeIy6pG%2Fpontem-liquidswap-halborn-audit.pdf?alt=media&token=7929b8c9-5073-4b36-9353-27e191d8774a) \n  - [Halborn - Flashloan](https://1969469778-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F7hOyaMi2Pz1hDJkk7WIF%2Fuploads%2FXMUwFtm3tS06WYdFeuKB%2Fpontem-liquidswap-flashloan-halborn-audit.pdf?alt=media&token=88bab0a4-7853-4cda-a260-a0b1e40027db)\n  - [Halborn - Dynamic Fees and Config](https://1969469778-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F7hOyaMi2Pz1hDJkk7WIF%2Fuploads%2F9ZKrZdfRnqOFX2Z0fQ6c%2Fpontem-liquidswap-dynamic-fees-config.pdf?alt=media&token=cfe8c319-60e6-4196-82c1-721d3e11c481) \n  - [Zellic - Liquidswap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CSnJZ_-YzUM9HZTeKXr7L4cBf3N-QFYU/view)\n\nThe team is aware of an issue causing LP burn to be aborted in wildly lopsided pools. There is also an overflow bug in the v1 router that has already been resolved. Bug reports related to these issues would be considered out of scope.  \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Liquidswap__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
