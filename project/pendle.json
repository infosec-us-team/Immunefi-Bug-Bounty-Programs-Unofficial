The project aims to give holders of yield-generating assets the opportunity to generate additional yield and to lock in future yield upfront, while offering traders direct exposure to future yield streams, without the need for an underlying collateral.\n\nFurther resources regarding the Pendle can be found on their website, [https://pendle.finance/](http://pendle.finance/). \n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the loss of user funds.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Solidity/EVM details not considered\n    - including integer over-/under-flow\n    - including unhandled exceptions\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n    - including composability vulnerabilities\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n  - Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n  - Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll smart contracts bug reports must come with a reproducible simulation PoC using either Hardhat or Foundry to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. However, in case no PoC can be created yet there are strong reasons to believe an exploit can take place, the team will still consider the submission.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, with the funds at risk being the primary determinant with considerations for PR impact and other factors such as exploitability, with a minimum base reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Pendle__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__ or __USDC__ for payouts under __USD 25 000__. For payouts above that amount, the reward will have  80% paid in __PENDLE__ with 20% in __USDT__ or __USDC__.",
