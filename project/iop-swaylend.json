If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nSwaylend is the port of Compound V3 lending protocol and architecture in the Sway programming language for the Fuel Network.\n\n**What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?**\n\nThe lending market smart contract supports Fuel's native assets - SRC-20 tokens. Both base assets and collateral assets are SRC-20.\n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs? Useful aspects of this question are:**\n\n- **Which parts of the code are you most concerned about?**\n- **What attack vectors are you most concerned about?**\n- **Which part(s) of the system do you want whitehats to attempt to break the most?**\n- **Are there any assumed invariants that you want whitehats to attempt to break?**\n\nSwaylend is the lending protocol that offers functionalities like other lending protocols, i.e., supplying base assets (in our case, USDC) and borrowing base assets in exchange for providing collateral assets. The most critical things that should be tested are:\n- Withdrawing only assets that you supplied\n- Borrowing only the amount you're allowed (based on supplied collateral asset and collateral factor)\n- Repaying the borrowed amount before withdrawing collateral asset\n\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nThere is one external dependency, which is an oracle that provides up-to-date prices for the tokens. In the current version, we use the Pyth oracle network to provide this data. Pyth oracle smart contract can be found at https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/fuel/contracts/pyth-contract/src/main.sw \n\n**Where might whitehats confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\nThere are additional smart contracts in the GitHub repository used for internal testing, but they are not within the scope. The only assets within scope are listed in the table above. External dependencies, such as the actual core implementation of the Pyth oracle, are also not in scope for this IOP.\n\n**Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse whitehats?**\n\nSwaylend is a monolithic lending protocol, meaning all functionalities are encompassed in a single smart contract. The lending positions of users are directly recorded in the smart contract, with no derivative tokens minted, as seen in some other lending protocols.\n\nLiquidations of undercollateralized positions occur through two steps: first, absorbing the collateral assets into the protocol, and then, in the next step, purchasing the collateral assets from the protocol in exchange for the market's base asset.\n\n\n**What is the test suite setup information?**\n\nThe test suite for the smart contracts is included in the GitHub repo (https://github.com/Swaylend/swaylend-contracts/tree/main/contracts/market/tests   ). Tests are written in Rust, and they should cover all functionalities of the lending protocol. \n\n**Public Disclosure of Known Issues**\n\nThere are no known open issues at the moment\n\n**Previous Audits**\n\nSwaylendâ€™s completed audit reports can be found at https://www.halborn.com/audits/swaylend  .USD. Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n**Asset Accuracy Assurance**\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n**Private Known Issues Reward Policy**\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward.\n\n**Known Issue Assurance**\n\nSwaylend commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Swaylend will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n**Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules**\n\nSwaylend adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page.",
      "impactsBody": "**Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements**\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n**Eligibility Criteria**\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this audit competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefiâ€™s best practice recommendations, Ionic has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",
