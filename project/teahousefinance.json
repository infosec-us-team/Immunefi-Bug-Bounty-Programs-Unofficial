      "programOverview": "Teahouse Finance is a multi-strategy DeFi investment platform dedicated to secure and flexible asset management.\n\nTeahouse Finance functions as a simplified layer above DeFi platforms such as Uniswap V3. This approach removes the complexities of managing liquidity and crypto assets, enabling users to deposit and entrust Teahouse Finance to generate passive income on their behalf.\n\nUsers can find a wide range of strategies on the Teahouse strategy platform. Teahouse Finance offers investment choices based on risk tolerance, selecting from low, medium, to high-risk strategies. Additionally, users have the flexibility to choose strategies aligned with their specific preferences and investment goals.\n\nFor more information about Teahouse Finance, please visit [https://teahouse.finance/](https://teahouse.finance/)\n\nTeahouse Finance provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nTeahouse Finance adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nTeahouse Finance adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract: Critical\n- Smart Contract: High\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nTeahouse Finance commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Teahouse Finance will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nTeahouse Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in the scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 600 blocks and then a third at 900 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 75% of the reward from the first attack, respectively.\n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors who directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nTeahouse Finance has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://vault.teahouse.finance/Teahouse-Finance_audit_report_2023-06-14.pdf](https://vault.teahouse.finance/Teahouse-Finance_audit_report_2023-06-14.pdf)\n- https://omniscia.io/reports/teahouse-finance-portfolio-strategy-65ad01e4cd79e50018d6fa75/ \n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nAt Immunefi, we sometimes receive reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. If it’s obviously feasible, then it seems there are no questions about severity or payout amount. But if the bug report is less feasible, or not really feasible at all, suddenly questions arise.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards)which by default state what a Project should or should not cite when downgrading a bug report’s impact, severity, and/or payout amount. These standards are continuously being developed and updated with the help of the community and encompass fair guidelines where the project clearly commits, and the security researcher can be assured that the project cannot arbitrarily downgrade the program based on theoretical counter measures, such as a [chain rollback. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract: Critical\n- Smart Contract: High\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Teahouse Finance team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "These impacts are out of the scope of this bug bounty program. \n\n__All Categories:__\n\n- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code\n- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production\n- Feature requests\n- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program\n\n__Blockchain/DLT & Smart Contract Specific:__\n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Lack of liquidity impacts\n- Impacts involving centralization risks\n\n__Prohibited Activities:__\n\n- Any testing on mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on local-forks of either public testnet or mainnet\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third-party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third-party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks that are executed against project assets\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",
