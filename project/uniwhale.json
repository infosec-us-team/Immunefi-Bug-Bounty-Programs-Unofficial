This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)\n",

This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract bug reports will be further capped at __10%__ of direct funds at risk or __USD 13 915__, whichever is smaller, if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 2 000__.\n\nRewards for high smart contract bug reports will be further capped at __10%__ of direct funds at risk or __USD 13 915__, whichever is smaller, if the bug discovered is exploited.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements:__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Uniwhale team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in UNW. Uniwhale commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements:__ \n\nUniwhale __does have__ a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n__KYC Info Required:__\n- Identify Proof (Passport, / Driving License / National ID)\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues:__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program.

Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: 1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and 2) zero payout. \n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited: \n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n- [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules](https://immunefi.com/rules/).
