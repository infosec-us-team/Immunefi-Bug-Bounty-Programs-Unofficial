Their backers include Jump Capital, Alameda Research, Defi Alliance, a41 and founders of other Solana projects such as Mercurial, Solanium and Raydium.\n\nThey are the first variable rate lending product that is live on Solana. Currently, Port Finance supports 13 different assets from the Solana, Ethereum, Terra and Bitcoin networks.\n\nIn December 2021, they launched their first fixed rate lending product Sundial and they believe that the fixed rate lending protocol will unleash the true potential of the Solana blockchain by providing an effective interest rate discovery mechanism using Serum.\n\nFor more information about Port Finance, please visit [https://port.finance/](https://port.finance/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of any user funds\n  - Insolvency of the platform",

All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts/Blockchain__\n\n  - Loss of user funds\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns with over a USD 10 000 difference",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System](https://immunefi.com/severity-updated). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nKnown issues highlighted in their previous audits linked below are considered out-of-scope: \n  - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iRy6v6_CsJKXOBSk_6mg4kmqvBL-Aqlj/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iRy6v6_CsJKXOBSk_6mg4kmqvBL-Aqlj/view?usp=sharing)\n  - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/16X4Su-zuxIxcCLbf7-dC2hQJdUW7oDaf/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16X4Su-zuxIxcCLbf7-dC2hQJdUW7oDaf/view?usp=sharing)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Port Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__, __PORT__ or a combination of both, at the discretion of the team.",
