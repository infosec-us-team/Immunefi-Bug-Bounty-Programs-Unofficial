Their backers include Jump Capital, Alameda Research, Defi Alliance, a41 and founders of other Solana projects such as Mercurial, Solanium and Raydium.\n\nThey are the first variable rate lending product that is live on Solana. Currently, Port Finance supports 13 different assets from the Solana, Ethereum, Terra and Bitcoin networks.\n\nIn December 2021, they launched their first fixed rate lending product Sundial and they believe that the fixed rate lending protocol will unleash the true potential of the Solana blockchain by providing an effective interest rate discovery mechanism using Serum.\n\nFor more information about Port Finance, please visit [https://port.finance/](https://port.finance/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of any user funds\n  - Insolvency of the platform",

However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nKnown issues highlighted in their previous audits linked below are considered out-of-scope: \n  - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iRy6v6_CsJKXOBSk_6mg4kmqvBL-Aqlj/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iRy6v6_CsJKXOBSk_6mg4kmqvBL-Aqlj/view?usp=sharing)\n  - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/16X4Su-zuxIxcCLbf7-dC2hQJdUW7oDaf/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16X4Su-zuxIxcCLbf7-dC2hQJdUW7oDaf/view?usp=sharing)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Port Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
