      "programOverview": "AMKT is a fully backed market index, providing exposure to a market-cap weighted basket of assets, to be reconstituted quarterly.\n\nAMKT is currently live [https://etherscan.io/token/0xf17a3fe536f8f7847f1385ec1bc967b2ca9cae8d.](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf17a3fe536f8f7847f1385ec1bc967b2ca9cae8d)\n\nThe next iteration of AMKT moves custody on chain. Relying on Vault to custody underlying assets, and on token governance to submit accurate bounties for the next set of underlying assets.\n\nFor more information about Alongside, please visit [https://alongside.xyz/.](https://alongside.xyz/)  \n\nAlongside provides rewards in USDC and AMKT. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nAlongside adheres to category 3 : Approval Required. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page. \n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAlongside adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract, Critical\n- Smart Contract, High\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nAlongside commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Alongside will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Invoicing Information__\n\nIf needed by the security researcher, Alongside is able to provide the necessary information for the proper issuance of an invoice. This includes:\n- Registered Name\n- Registered Address\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 150,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities will be capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing and permanent freezing of funds, the reward doubles for every additional 300  blocks that the funds or NFTs could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 300, up to the hard cap of USD 10,000. However, a minimum reward of USD 2,500 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. For “Manipulation of governance voting result deviating from voted outcome and resulting in a direct change from intended effect of original results” impact, a fixed reward of USD 10,000 will apply.  \n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- Cannot Support atypical ERC20s\n- Trusted Authority Role (Timelock)\n- Trusted Authority Role (Multisig)\n- Trusted Authority Role (Emergency Responder)\n- Trusted Bounty Poster / Oracle\n- Assumes Bounty has been checked for correctness: duplicates/includes all underlying\n- Rebalance will have some slippage because of the delay in computing the nominals and it being fulfilled. This means if the price of the tokens going out are less than the price of the tokens going in, it's on the person fulfilling the bounty to cover this. In other words this trade may not easily be profitable. \n- Governance has not executed any proposals yet, including the one to accept ownership of vault. This can be ignored. \n- Rounding in tryInflation will cause drift between vault balance and nominal calculation\n- tryInflation can be sandwiched to skirt fees (or profit, if there are AMKT lending markets)\n- AMKT is limited as a governance token, creating centralization risks for users\n- Ownership transfer risks in migration process\n- Delay in rebalancing process could lead to exploitation\n- Protocol governance initially has low token delegation\n- Bounty fulfillments may arbitrarily update the precision of the total basket of tokens\n- setInflationRate will apply the rate retroactively\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAlongside has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://github.com/Alongside-Finance/Audits/blob/main/Solidified_April_22.pdf ](https://github.com/Alongside-Finance/Audits/blob/main/Solidified_April_22.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/Alongside-Finance/Audits/blob/main/SigmaPrime_Sept_28.pdf ](https://github.com/Alongside-Finance/Audits/blob/main/SigmaPrime_Sept_28.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/zobront/audits/blob/main/reports/alongside.md ](https://github.com/zobront/audits/blob/main/reports/alongside.md)\n- [https://github.com/Alongside-Finance/Audits/blob/main/Cantina.pdf ](https://github.com/Alongside-Finance/Audits/blob/main/Cantina.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/Alongside-Finance/Audits/blob/main/Cantina-2.pdf](https://github.com/Alongside-Finance/Audits/blob/main/Cantina-2.pdf)\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nBug reports that require an attack that involve one or more other protocols (e.g. utilizing flash loans from a margin protocol or manipulating the spot prices on a DEX), either to make an attack more severe than it would be in isolation, or to achieve an attack that would otherwise be impossible or infeasible, would be out of scope. However, they will be considered as in-scope and categorized according to the program rules as long as all of the following are true:\n- Losses or other negative effects of the attack are inflicted upon Alongside ecosystem participants \n- The additional protocols used must have enough liquidity in various assets to allow the attack to succeed at the time of bug report submission. For example: if an attack requires an ETH flash loan, but the amount is larger than all the ETH available for loan across the ecosystem\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract, Critical\n- Smart Contract, High\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Alongside team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC  and AMKT. The payout ratio will be 50% in USDC and 50% in AMKT.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n",
