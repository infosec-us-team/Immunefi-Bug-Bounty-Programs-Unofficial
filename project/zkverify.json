      "rewardsBody": "__Rewards by Threat Level__\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. \nReward Calculation for Critical Level Reports\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 5% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward $50,000. However, a minimum reward of USD $15,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown): $15,000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork): $15,000\n\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk, which includes all affected projects on top of the respective blockchain/DLT, and the market cap according to the average between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com, calculated at the time the bug report is submitted. \n\n\nFor critical web/apps bugs, reports will be rewarded with $10,000, only if the impact leads to:\nA loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\nPrivate key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of $5,000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high Blockchain/DLT non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments: $5000\n- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters: $5000\n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.",
