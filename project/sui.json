      "programOverview": "Sui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of validators that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.\n\nSui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for simple use cases. Sui makes most transactions processable in parallel. This better utilizes processing resources and offers the option to increase throughput by adding more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for simple use cases, such as payment transactions and assets transfer. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nReserve adheres to __category 2__. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\nFor more information about Sui, please visit [https://sui.io/](https://sui.io/)  \n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Please review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/) This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nFor “Loss of Funds” impact, Sui is looking for the following:\n- Unauthorized creation, copying, transfer or destruction of objects via bypass of or exploit of bugs in the Move or Sui bytecode verifier\n- Address Collision – creating two distinct authentication schemes that hash to the same SUI address in a manner that lead to significant loss of funds\n- Object ID collision—creating two distinct objects with the same ID in a manner that leads to significant loss of funds.\n- Unauthorized use of an owned object as a transaction input, resulting in significant loss of funds due to the inability to verify ownership and permission to transfer\n- Dynamically loading an object that is not directly or transitively owned by the transaction sender, in a manner that leads to significant loss of funds\n- Unauthorized upgrade of a Move package, in a manner that leads to significant loss of funds\n- Stealing staking rewards that belong to another user, or claiming more than a user’s share of staking rewards, not including rounding errors that result in a minor, financially insignificant discrepancy\n\nFor “Violating BFT assumptions, acquiring voting power vastly disproportionate to stake, or any other issue that can meaningfully compromise the integrity of the blockchain’s proof of stake governance” impact, it does not include the following: \n- Voting power that is redistributed because one or more other validators already has max voting power\n- Rounding errors that result in minor voting power discrepancies\n\nValid bug reports related to Blockchain/DLT safety will be eligible for the maximum bounty reward of __$500,000 USD__. Valid bug reports that are DoS/liveness related will be eligible for the minimum critical bounty reward amount of __$100,000 USD__\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements:__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Sui team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in USDC via Coinlist in accordance with the requirements listed under \"KYC Requirements\" below. Sui commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements__\n\nSui __does__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. KYC will be handled through Coinlist. \n\nKYC Info Required:\n- Resident Street Address\n- Date of Birth\n- SSN if US Resident\n- Government Issued ID Card (Passport, Driver’s License, Identity Card)\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.  \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n\n- In our staking contract, we have the concept of pool tokens and keep track of exchange rates between pool tokens and SUI tokens of all epochs, which increase as more rewards are added to the staking pools. When a user withdraws their stake, we retrieve from that record both the exchange rate at staking time and the current exchange rate (at withdrawing time), and calculate the rewards to be paid out based on the difference in exchange rates. While doing this calculation, we do conversions both ways: pool tokens -> SUI and SUI -> pool tokens. Rounding may happen along the way due to integer division. The exchange rate between the two tokens should stay roughly the same since we will be burning a proportional amount of pool tokens as SUI is withdrawn. However, in the extreme case where a user is unstaking 1 MIST, this rounding error may cause ZERO pool tokens to be burnt, causing the pool token to effectively depreciate. If an attacker has a lot of 1 MIST stakes, they can withdraw them one by one, causing the pool token exchange rate to drop and other takers to “lose” their staking rewards. I put quotation marks around “lose” because the attacker themselves won’t get any of that rewards so this attacker doesn’t actually make economic sense. Rather the rewards stay in the rewards pool and will become dust. This issue is mitigated by enforcing a minimum staking amount of 1 SUI or 10^9 MIST in this PR:\n[https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/9961](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/9961)\nRelated Impact-in-Scope: Critical - Any other issue leading to theft or loss of valuable objects, with severity depending on the consequences of the issue and the preconditions for exploiting it.\n- __Excessive storage rebate on 0x5 object right after epoch change:__\nEach on-chain object is associated with a storage rebate, which would be refunded to the owner if it ever gets deleted. Epoch change transactions are special in that they are system transactions without a sender, hence any excessive storage rebate generated in that transaction is kept in the 0x5 object. This means that the first person touching the 0x5 object in each epoch may be able to obtain those excessive rebate by simply touching this object (e.g. a failed staking request). We will look into a way to evenly distribute those excessive rebates such that is does not lead to any undesired behaviors.\n",
