We are committed to ensuring the utmost security in our community-vetted smart contracts, and our bounty program provides rewards of up to $25,000 USD for reporting critical vulnerabilities in our smart contracts library. \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on OpenZeppelin Stellar Contracts and mainly intends to prevent:\n- Loss of funds by freezing another user’s funds, or theft of another user’s funds\n- Permanent denial of service (smart contract is made unable to operate)\n- Access control bypass, including privilege escalation\n- Smart contract not behaving as intended\n\nFor more information about OpenZeppelin on Stellar, please visit https://docs.openzeppelin.com/stellar-contracts/0.1.0/.\n\nOpenZeppelin on Stellar provides rewards in XLM on Stellar, denominated in USD.\n\nFor more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__Previous Audits__\nOpenZeppelin on Stellar’s completed audit reports can be found at https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/audits. Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nOpenZeppelin’s bug bounty program requires an invoice to be submitted and a KYC screen to be performed prior to OpenZeppelin providing a bug bounty reward. Once a payout is confirmed, a member of OpenZeppelin will reach out to you directly to collect the necessary information, including:\n- Full Legal Name\n- Email Address\n- Mailing Address\n- Wallet Address (Stellar Only)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.\nA PoC compliant with Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract: Critical\n- Smart Contract: High\n\nBugs introduced by a release candidate version and reported during the review period, the dates for which will be declared by OpenZeppelin on each release, will receive a 50% bonus.",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nThe rewards stated here are additive to any existing bug bounty programs hosted by projects that are currently using OpenZeppelin on Stellar contracts.\n\nBounty rewards are given according to an [impact/likelihood matrix for assessing threat levels. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenZeppelin/immunefi-assets/main/impact-likelihood-matrix.png?utm_source=immunefi)Each issue is assessed considering the likelihood of the vulnerability being successfully exploited and the expected impact in scope to a single instance of the affected smart contract. Note that, as can be seen in the matrix, if the impact is Critical then the threat is always Critical, for other impacts the maximum reduction is one level only if the likelihood is low, and if the likelihood is high then the threat is increased one level above the impact.\n\n__Critical Reward Calculation__\nMainnet assets:\n- Reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of: $25,000\n- Minimum reward to discourage security researchers from withholding a bug report: $5,000\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\n- Total maximum payout for this bug bounty contest is $250,000.\n- Maximum single bounty payout is capped at $25,000.",
