A baseline reward pool of $50,000 USD will be distributed among participants even if no valid bugs are found. For this boost, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward.\n\nDeGate will respond within 24 hours on weekdays to all bug reports. Any technical questions and support requests can be asked directly to DeGate or Immunefi in the [DeGate Boost Discord channel.](https://discord.com/channels/787092485969150012/1173840561455775744)\n\nWhen the boost has ended Immunefi will publish an event-specific leaderboard and bug reports from the event. \n\nDeGate deployed approximately 500 nSLOC designed to allow them to upgrade their contracts. This new code is the target of this boosted bug bounty. DeGate is most interested in bugs in how their new contracts were deployed and how they interact with their protocol.\n\nA high level overview of the code which is in scope for this boost can be found here: [https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/commit/180138015197c886ec3c87efa8bf0031b653359f#commitcomment-132582143](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/commit/180138015197c886ec3c87efa8bf0031b653359f#commitcomment-132582143)\n\nOnly the proxies themselves are in scope for this Boost. Bugs in the implementation contracts are out of scope, but are valid for a reward in [DeGate's normal bug bounty program,](https://immunefi.com/bounty/degate/) and should be submitted there instead.\n\n__Project Overview__\n\n[DeGate](https://degate.com/) is a decentralized orderbook exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain that utilizes zero-knowledge technology. DeGate DEX offers spot market trading with limit orders and also offers a grid trading function.\n\nDeGate operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DEX platform is focused on being user-friendly and is built on the principle of Trustlessness. With DeGate’s unique Efficient Gas Saving technology, users can expect super-low gas fees while using a decentralized protocol. Another critical component of DeGate is the Permissionless Listing feature which enables any token to be listed in a permissionless manner on DeGate’s orderbook DEX.\n\nFor more information about DeGate, visit [https://docs.degate.com](https://docs.degate.com)",

      "rewardsBody": "This boosted bug bounty has $400,000 USD in rewards split across 3 reward pools. $300,000 is allocated to the Criticals reward pool, $50,000 to the Highs reward pool, and $50,000 to the Baseline rewards pool.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the DeGate team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in USDC.\n\nRewards will be distributed all at once after the event has concluded and the final bug reports have been resolved.\n\nThe following reward rules are a summary, for an in-depth explanation read our [Reward Distribution Rules article](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20215594250385-DeGate-s-Boosted-Bug-Bounty-Reward-Distribution-Rules). The reward mechanisms are designed to reward all high quality whitehat work, with the greatest rewards for Critical issues and unique findings.\n\n__Duplicate & Private Known Issue Reward Policy__\n\nDuplicate bug reports which are in-scope for this event are considered valid and will be rewarded in a Sybil-resistant manner. Attempts to abuse the duplicate reward policy will result in a ban and forfeit of all rewards.\nPrivate known issues, meaning bugs known to the project but not publicly disclosed, which are in scope for this event are considered valid and will be rewarded at a reduced rate of 25%.\n\n__Baseline Reward Pool__\n\nThe $50,000 USD baseline reward pool is distributed among all participants. 80% is split among all valid report submissions based on the bug’s severity. 20% is distributed at Immunefi’s discretion to highly valuable reports, even if they’re technically invalid, and other significant contributions.\nThe entire baseline reward pool will be distributed even if no valid bugs are found.\n\n__Criticals Reward Pool__\n\nThe $300,000 USD Criticals reward pool is distributed among all valid Critical severity reports. This reward pool is split among all Critical bug submissions with 80% going to the primary finder and 20% going to all other finders in a Sybil-resistant way. The primary finder is the first whitehat to demonstrate how the bug is Critical severity.\nIf no Critical severity bugs are found then this reward pool is not distributed.\n\n__Highs Reward Pool__\n\nThe $50,000 USD Highs reward pool is distributed among all valid High severity reports. This reward pool is split among all High bug submissions with 80% going to the primary finder and 20% going to all other finders in a Sybil-resistant way. The primary finder is the first whitehat to demonstrate how the bug is High severity.\nIf no High severity bugs are found then this reward pool is not distributed.",

This means that DeGate will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission.\n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nThis timeboxed bug bounty adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole timeboxed bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated on this page.\n\nIf your bug report demonstrates an impact which does not originate from or depend on the assets in scope of this timeboxed bug bounty program then it may be valid for a reward on [DeGate’s normal bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/degate/), which utilizes Primacy of Impact.",
      "impactsBody": "__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__List of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC777 that DeGate Can Interact With:__\n\n- DeGate is permissionless and can interact with all ERC20s. However, impacts involving balance changes and authority freezes caused by the token contract itself are out of scope, such as rebase tokens\n- ERC721 and ERC777 are incompatible with DeGate\n\n__Validity of bugs dependent on 100% trusted actors or privileged addresses:__\n\n- DeGate is built on the principle of Trustlessness, or ‘Can’t do evil’. Impacts due to the unintended functions of an Operator are especially valuable and valid for a reward.\n- DeGate is interested in all impacts caused by the unintended functionality of multisig owners. Such bugs are in scope and valid for a reward, with the exception of impacts dependent on the multisig owners proposing new malicious code that will only implement after a 45 day delay.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that can not be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/18488140853905-Feasibility-Limitations)which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.",

      "feasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
