It allows its holders to participate in the ApeCoin DAO and provides access to exclusive games, merch, events, services, and more.\n\nEarlier this year, the DAO voted to launch a staking system to incentivize engagement within the ecosystem. ApeCoin staking will allow users to stake their APE in various pools to gain rewards. Anyone holding ApeCoin can participate, however additional pools are available to holders who own NFTs within the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem.\n\nFor more information about Apecoin and staking, please visit [https://apecoin.com](https://apecoin.com/) and read [AIP-21](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-21-staking-process-with-caps-1x-drop-process/5074) and [AIP-22](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-22-staking-pool-allocation-reloaded-ecosystem-fund-allocation/5071).\n\nThe program will continue for the life of the staking system (3 years).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects. However, there is a minimum reward for critical vulnerabilities of __USD 100 000__. \n\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nAll vulnerabilities marked acknowledged and accepted in the [Halborn security review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ppauv4me-WWWKIwWUUiWP32vtisXcKKg/view?usp=share_link) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nApeCoin requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. Recipients must provide their name, certificate of incorporation (if a company), physical address, email address, ethereum address to receive the funds, and confirmation on whether the ethereum address is at an exchange or other custodian, or owned directly by the recipient. They will also be required to sign the ApeCoin foundation’s standard grant agreement document. The collection of this information will be done by the project team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __ApeCoin Foundation__ directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, all payouts are done in __ApeCoin (APE)__.",
