Ambire is a smart wallet, which enables paying gas in stablecoins, automatic Flashbots/Eden frontrunning protection, batching (doing multiple things in one tx!), hardware wallets (Trezor/Ledger). It is web based, thereâ€™s no extension required, and you can connect to any dApp with WalletConnect.\n\nFor more information about Ambire, please visit [https://www.ambire.com/](https://www.ambire.com/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount \n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Theft of governance funds \n  - Governance activity disruption",

All Low and Medium Smart contract bug reports require a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n[https://github.com/AmbireTech/code4rena#known-tradeoffs](https://github.com/AmbireTech/code4rena#known-tradeoffs)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Ambire__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
