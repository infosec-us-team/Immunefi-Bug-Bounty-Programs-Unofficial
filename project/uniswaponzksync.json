      "programOverview": "The Uniswap Protocol is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that uses a set of smart contracts to execute trades. It is an open source project and falls into the category of a DeFi product because it uses smart contracts to facilitate trades.\n\nzkSync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or decentralization. Since it's EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring or re-auditing a single line of code. zkSync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers write smart contracts in C++, Rust and other popular languages.\n\nThis program is based on Uniswap V3 on zkSync. \n\nFor more information about the Uniswap Protocol,  please visit [https://docs.uniswap.org/](https://docs.uniswap.org/)\n\nThis project is being run by the Uniswap Foundation. The Foundation provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \nThis bug bounty program is intended to identify and reward bugs in code specific to the zkSync deployment of Uniswap V3. It does not cover any issues related to the Ethereum network, the Uniswap Protocol, or any other third-party.\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nUniswap Foundation may request a government ID during the process.\n\n__Eligibility Requirement__ \n\nPer Uniswap Foundation’s guidelines to be eligible for a reward under this Program, you must:\n- Discover a previously-unreported, non-public vulnerability that is not previously known by the team and within the scope of this Program.\n- Be the first to disclose the unique vulnerability in compliance with the disclosure requirements.\n- Provide sufficient information to enable our engineers to reproduce\n- Not exploit the vulnerability in any way, including through making it public or by obtaining a profit (other than a reward under this Program).\n- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, interruption or degradation of any of the assets in scope.\n- Not submit a vulnerability caused by an underlying issue that is the same as an issue on which a reward has been paid under this Program.\n- Not engage in any unlawful conduct when disclosing the bug including through threats, demands, or any other coercive tactics.\n- Not be subject to US sanctions or reside in a US-embargoed country.\n- Not be one of our current or former employees, or a vendor or contractor who has been involved in the development of the code of the bug in question.\n- Comply with all the eligibility requirements of the Program.\n.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nUniswap Foundation adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Uniswap Foundation has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 20 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the blockchain/DLT component or smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded/paused/killed, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading, pausing, or in some cases, killing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\nFor critical repeatable attacks on blockchain/DLT components or smart contracts that can not be upgraded/paused/killed, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.   \n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward increases at a multiplier of two from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.    \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Uniswap Foundation team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
