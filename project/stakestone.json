      "programOverview": "StakeStone is committed to building the first stable, yield-bearing liquid ETH/BTC, powered by an adaptive staking network that supports various risk-free consensus layers with native assets. Yield opportunities are optimized through adaptable underlying strategies using an on-chain proposal mechanism called OPAP, which seamlessly redistributes omnichain liquidity across ecosystems and protocols. Backed by leading investors such as Binance Labs, OKX Ventures, SevenX, HashKey Capital & HashKey Cloud, Amber Group, Cobo, Nomad Capital, Symbolic Capital, Dao5, and Bankless Ventures.\n\nFor more information about StakeStone, please visit [https://stakestone.io/](https://stakestone.io/)\n\nStakeStone provides rewards in __USDC__ on Ethereum, denominated in __USD__. For more details about the payment process, please view the __Rewards by Threat Level__ section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nImmunefi will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n- Eligibility Criteria \n\n\n__Primacy of Rules__\n\nStakeStone adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nStakeStone’s completed audit reports can be found at https://docs.stakestone.io/stakestone/additionals/audits-and-security. Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, StakeStone has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on severity and impact.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 300 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 20 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\nFor critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 5 000 to USD 20 000, depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional [24h] that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the StakeStone team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __USDC__ on __ETH__.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
