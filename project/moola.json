Moola has shared ancestry with Aave v2.\n\nFor more information about Moola, please visit [https://moola.market/](https://moola.market/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts, website and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Website goes down\n  - Leak of user data\n  - Deletion of user data\n  - Access to sensitive pages without authorization",

Bug bounty hunters will need to show a government-issued ID, including a physical address.\n\n__Critical Smart Contract reward__ is $10,000 USD or up to 1% of MOO supply\n__High Smart Contract reward__ $5,000 USD or up to 0.5% of MOO supply\n__Critical Web/App reward__ is 2,000 USD or up to 0.2% of MOO supply\n__High Web/App reward__ is 1,000 USD or up to 0.1% of MOO supply\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Moola__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __cUSD__ or __MOO__ at the discretion of the team. For payouts done in __MOO__, the price of __MOO__ will be calculated based on a 30-day average USD price.
