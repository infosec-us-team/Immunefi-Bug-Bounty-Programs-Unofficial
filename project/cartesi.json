This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. All Medium, High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Tokens transferred directly to a pool (through a ERC-20 transfer), without using the \"deposit\" transaction, are locked permanently. Those tokens are staked to the Staking contract, improving its productivity, but they don't belong to anyone and cannot be recovered.\n\n  - If a delegator deposits tokens and then the pool manager pauses (locks) the pool, the delegator needs to wait for the pool to be unpaused (unlocked) so he can stake those tokens. He still has the option to withdraw those tokens while the pool is paused (locked).\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Cartesi__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __CTSI__ and __Stablecoins__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.",
