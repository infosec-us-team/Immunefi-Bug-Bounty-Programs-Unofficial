Liquidity Providers put their tokens in the pools in order to collect swap fees. \n\nBalancer adopts powerful features to slash gas costs, super-charge capital efficiency, unlock arbitrage with zero-token starting capital, and open the door to custom AMMs.\n\nFor more information about Balancer, please visit [https://balancer.fi/](https://balancer.fi/).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll Critical/High severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at __10%__ of economic damage, taking into account the funds at risk at the moment of the bug report submission. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 250 000__. Additionally, the maximum reward is capped at __USD 1 000 000__, even if __10%__ of the damage in USD equivalent is greater than __USD 1 000 000__.\n\nHigh severity smart contract vulnerabilities are also further capped at __10%__ of economic damage, taking into account the funds at risk at the moment of the bug report submission. However, there is a minimum reward of __50 000 USD__. Additionally, the maximum reward is capped at __USD 250 000__, even if __10%__ of the damage is greater than __USD 250 000__.\n\nVulnerabilities involving non-standard ERC20 tokens are considered out of scope, as it would be trivial to insert an exploit into a token for the sake of applying to this bug bounty. A standard, Balancer-compatible ERC20 token is one that conforms to all [EIP-20 interfaces](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) and exhibits expected behavior in implementation; i.e., transfers move exactly N tokens from sender to recipient, and balances do not change by any means other than transfers. Notably, tokens with transfer fees, rebasing supplies, streaming mechanics or multiple entrypoints are not compatible with Balancer, but that list is not exhaustive.\n\nKnown issues such as those previously highlighted in the following audit report are considered out of scope (list is not exhaustive): \n  - [https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/audits](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/audits) \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Balancer__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__.
