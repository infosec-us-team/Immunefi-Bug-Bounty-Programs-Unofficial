      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All High and Critical Blockchain bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code are required.\n\nThe rewards for reporting Critical Blockchain vulnerabilities are capped at __10%__ of the potential economic damage, or __USD 250,000__ (whichever is higher). Economic damage is limited to the situation where there is a reasonable risk for existing funds on the HydraDX platform. Indirect damages such as reputational damage are out of scope. The assessment of the extent of any potential economic damage is at the full discretion of the Galactic Council. However, there is a minimum reward of ___USD 15,000___ for reporting any vulnerability which can be classified under the category Critical Blockchain.\n\nAll potential vulnerabilities are assessed by the Galactic Council based on internally established criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in place. \n\nHigh blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are scaled based on internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in place. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5,000__, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nWith regard to Blockchain vulnerabilities, only code involving runtime pallets of HydraDX and pallets developed by Galactic Council are considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. Pallets that are not in the mainnet runtime, are not live or are under development are considered as out-of-scope of the bug bounty program. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Galactic Council__ directly and are denominated in USD. However, the payouts are done in __HDX__.\n",
