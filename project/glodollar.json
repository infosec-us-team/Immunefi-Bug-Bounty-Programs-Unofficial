The difference: we give all of it away to reduce extreme poverty. You can generate basic income for people in extreme poverty simply by owning Glo. More Glo adoption means more basic income for more people.\n\nFor more information about Glo, please visit [https://www.glodollar.org/](https://www.glodollar.org/)",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nGlo requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed are name, address, date and full amount you claim, clearly stated on an invoice. The collection of this information will be done by the project team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Glo__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__. ",
