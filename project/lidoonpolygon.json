Stake your MATIC with Lido to receive stMATIC tokens which can be traded, transferred and used across the growing Polygon DeFi space.\n\nFor more information about Lido, the parent project, please visit their main bug bounty program at [https://immunefi.com/bounty/lido/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lido/).\n\nFor more information about Lido on Polygon, please visit [https://lido.fi/polygon](https://lido.fi/polygon).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts, website and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Any governance voting result manipulation\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Miner-extractable value (MEV)\n  - Insolvency\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Ability to execute system commands\n  - Extract Sensitive data/files from the server such as /etc/passwd\n  - Stealing User Cookies\n  - Taking Down the application/website\n  - Signing transactions for other users\n  - Redirection of user deposits and withdrawals\n  - Subdomain takeover resulting in financial loss (applicable for subdomains with addresses published)\n  - Wallet interaction modification resulting in financial loss\n  - Direct theft of user funds \n  - Tampering with transactions submitted to the user’s wallet\n  - Submitting malicious transactions to an already-connected wallet\n\nVulnerability reported to any Lido project is considered as reported to each Lido Bug Bounty program.
