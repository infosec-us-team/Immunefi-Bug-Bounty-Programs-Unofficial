      "programOverview": "Strike is an autonomous and decentralized money market that enables variable based rates for supplying digital asset collaterals to the protocol and from borrowing digital assets from the protocol with over-collateralized assets. \n\nThe tokenization of digital assets onto the Strike protocol will unlock liquidity from that asset without having to liquidate and/or sell that asset in the market. Money Markets allow users to tap into a peer-to-peer marketplace where all interactions are validated against open-source smart contracts running on the immutable Ethereum blockchain. \n\nThe entire Strike protocol is operated by its community with no centralized control or team tokens exercising power over the protocol’s governance. Strike is designed to protect the equilibrium between borrowers and suppliers by allowing liquidators to handle bad vaults and collecting a premium for stabilizing the protocol. Strike users are in control by interacting with the STRK utility token to govern and operate the platform with consensus.\n\nFor more information about Strike Finance, please visit [https://strike.org/](https://strike.org/).\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nStrike Finance adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nStrike Finance completed audit reports can be accessed on  [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/strikefinance](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/strikefinance) for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Strike Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__ \n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Solidity/EVM details not considered\n    - including integer over-/under-flow\n    - including rounding errors\n    - including unhandled exceptions\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n    - including composability vulnerabilities\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n  - Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n  - Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces\n\n__Websites and Apps__\n\n  - Remote Code Execution\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - Vertical Privilege Escalation\n  - XML External Entities Injection\n  - SQL Injection\n  - LFI/RFI\n  - Horizontal Privilege Escalation\n  - Stored XSS\n  - Reflective XSS with impact\n  - CSRF with impact\n  - Direct object reference\n  - Internal SSRF\n  - Session fixation\n  - Insecure Deserialization\n  - DOM XSS\n  - SSL misconfigurations\n  - SSL/TLS issues (weak crypto, improper setup)\n  - URL redirect\n  - Clickjacking (must be accompanied with PoC)\n  - Misleading Unicode text (e.g. using right to left override characters)",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 50 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n  - If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n  - For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that can not be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n  - High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward of USD 10 000. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.   \n\n  - In the event of temporary freezing, the reward increases at a multiplier of two from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.      \n\nFor critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 15 000__ only if the impact leads to:\n\n  - A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n  - Unauthorized minting of tokens on-chain\n  - Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of __USD 5 000__. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Strike Finance__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __STRK__.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
