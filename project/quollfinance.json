This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 5 000 for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 100% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward for high vulnerabilities of USD 2 500.\n\nMedium smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 100% of economic damage, primarily based on value at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team.
