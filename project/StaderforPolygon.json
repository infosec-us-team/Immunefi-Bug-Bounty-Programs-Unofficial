This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.</p><p>All  bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.</p><p>Rewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of <strong>USD 100 000</strong> for Critical smart contract bug reports. </p><p>Previous issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope of this program: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/halborn/StaderLabs_MaticX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf\">https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/halborn/StaderLabs_MaticX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf </a></li><li><a href=\"https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/polygon/StaderLabs_maticX_Audit_Report_Immunebytes.pdf\">https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/polygon/StaderLabs_maticX_Audit_Report_Immunebytes.pdf</a></li></ul><p>Payouts are handled by the <strong>Stader for Polygon</strong> team directly and are denominated in USD.
