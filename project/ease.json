We’re starting with Compound and a few USDC contracts that require normalization so we must prevent any problems as this would likely lead to a critical.\n  - Protocol composability problems. Each shield adapter functions differently and there could be high or critical severity problems here.\n  - Conversion rates. On mint/redeem if our calculations are off this could easily lead to criticals.\n  - Merkle trees for pricing or liquidation amounts being able to be manipulated in some way.\n\nIn case of discrepancy between [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-1/) and Ease’s classification above, Ease’s classification will be followed.",
