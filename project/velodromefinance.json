      "programOverview": "Velodrome Finance is a revolutionary new AMM based on Solidly launched on Optimism. The Optimism Foundation is excited to announce its latest bug bounty matching program, specifically designed for Velodrome Finance - a next-generation AMM that combines the best of Curve, Convex and Uniswap, designed to serve as Optimism's central liquidity hub. \n\nIn collaboration with Immunefi, the Optimism Foundation aims to encourage and incentivize security researchers to find and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. This will contribute to a safer ecosystem for all Optimism participants involved and showcase the foundation's commitment to security. \n\nTo participate, security researchers should focus on identifying critical and high Velodrome-specific vulnerabilities that could potentially impact the wider Optimism ecosystem. Optimism will match any rewards offered by Velodrome, contributing a total of 152.5K OP tokens.\n\nFor more information about Velodrome Finance, please visit [Velodrome Finance.](https://app.velodrome.finance/)\n\nVelodrome Finance provides rewards in USDC and OP. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n- A legal/individual entity to issue a payment/invoice for/on-behalf of the security researcher.\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nVelodrome Finance adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nVelodrome Finance adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Smart Contract: Critical: Protocol insolvency\n- Smart Contract: High: Unintended alteration of what the NFT represents (e.g. token URI, payload, artistic content)\n- Smart Contract: High: Theft of unclaimed royalties\n- Smart Contract: High: Permanent freezing of unclaimed royalties\n- Smart Contract: High: Temporary freezing of funds\n- Smart Contract: High: Temporary freezing NFTs\n- Smart Contract: Medium: Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds\n- Smart Contract: Medium: Block stuffing\n- Smart Contract: Medium: Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)\n- Smart Contract: Medium: Theft of gas\n- Smart Contract: Medium: Unbounded gas consumption\n- Smart Contract: Low: Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nVelodrome Finance commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Velodrome Finance will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\nThe Spearbit audit was completed on 16th of June, 2023 and the report was published on 17th of July, 2023:\n\n[https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/raw/master/pdfs/Velodrome-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/raw/master/pdfs/Velodrome-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf)\n\nSlipstream audit was completed by Spearbit on 5th of December 2023 and the report was published on 22nd of January 2024:\n\n[https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/Velodrome-Spearbit-Security-Review-Nov23.pdf](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/Velodrome-Spearbit-Security-Review-Nov23.pdf)\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nVelodrome Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 20% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $100,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 1800 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities will be capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles for every additional 30 blocks that the funds or NFTs could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 30, up to the hard cap of USD $20,000.\n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- Security researchers from OFAC-sanctioned countries\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract, Critical\n- Smart Contract, High\n- Smart Contract, Medium\n- Smart Contract, Low\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nAs part of the bug bounty matching program, Optimism will contribute __152,500__ OP tokens to match the rewards offered by Velodrome. This means that for every reward paid out by Velodrome to a security researcher, Optimism will provide an additional, matching reward, in OP tokens. The total reward pool for this program is __152,500__ OP tokens\n\nPayouts are handled by the Velodrome Finance team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC and OP. The payment scheme involves three forms of currency: USD Coin (USDC), Velodrome Token (VELO), and Optimism Token (OP). 50% of the total payout is made in USD Coin or VELO and the remaining 50% of the payout is made in OP.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n",
