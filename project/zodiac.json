Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nGnosis requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is an invoice including:\n  - Full Name or Business Name\n  - Personal or Business Address\n  - Invoice number\n  - Invoiced amount and currency\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Gnosis__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
