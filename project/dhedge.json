  "rewardsBody": "If a vulnerability is found in integration-related contracts (such as contract guards or asset guards), the funds at risk should be calculated per chain, based on which deployments actually include the affected integration.\n\nIn the dHEDGE system, managers/traders are generally not considered trusted, and issues exploitable by a manager/trader are typically treated as putting user funds at risk. However, this assumption does not apply to vaults managed directly by the protocol team. Vaults operated by dHEDGE itself or by incubated protocols under its operational control (e.g., Toros, mStable) should be considered trusted. Therefore, if a vulnerability is exploitable only by a permissioned manager/trader, the funds at risk should exclude vaults under direct team management.\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk.",
