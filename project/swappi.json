      "programOverview": "Swappi is an automated market maker (AMM) based decentralized exchange (DEX) deployed on Conflux Network, allowing Conflux users to have a new venue to swap, stake, and earn yields on their crypto assets. As an AMM-based DEX, Swappi lets users trade, add liquidity, earn fees and LP tokens, stake LP tokens to earn PPI, and stake PPI for additional rewards and farming opportunities. \n\nSwappi is the very first DEX to launch on eSpace, an EVM-compatible smart contract execution environment built on top of Conflux that allows developers to deploy and execute Ethereum-native dApps and smart contracts within the Conflux ecosystem.\n\nFor more information about Swappi, please visit [https://docs.swappi.io/swappi/](https://docs.swappi.io/swappi/).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__. \n\nAll vulnerabilities marked in the [Certik security review](https://www.certik.com/projects/swappi-finance) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Swappi__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
