The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers are required to submit KYC within 14 days of KYC being requested, else their rewards may be forfeited. Immunefi may make exceptions due to extenuating circumstances.\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFAC's SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this Audit Competition bug bounty and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Celo has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\nCelo is transitioning from a standalone EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2. This shift, proposed by cLabs in July 2023, aims to maintain the seamless user experience that Celo is known for—characterized by speed, low costs, and ease of use—while leveraging Ethereum's security and ecosystem.\n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs? Which parts of the code are you most concerned about?__\n\nExperimental Features, Custom Gas Token, Alternate Data Availability Layer implementation in the OP Stack.\n\n__What attack vectors are you most concerned about?__\n\nMigration to L2 and Sequencer \n\n__Which part(s) of the system do you want whitehats to attempt to break the most?__\n\nCustom Gas Currency (https://docs.celo.org/cel2/fee-currencies)\n\n__What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?__\n\nAll ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 standards are supported. \n\n__What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?__\n\nTest on Testnet: [https://docs.celo.org/cel2/network-information](https://docs.celo.org/cel2/network-information)\n\n__What monitoring systems may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?__\n\nThird-party security review\nBlockchain Explorer\n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nAny is fine on Testnet\n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\n\n[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)\n\n__Where might whitehats confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?__\n\nOpen source code in defined repos are in scope. Anything on testnet is in scope. Cel2 code is not deployed to Mainnet. \n\nstCelo (staked-celo) is live and on Mainnet, this is in scope.  \n\n__What is the test suite setup information?__\n\n- [https://docs.celo.org/cel2/network-information](https://docs.celo.org/cel2/network-information)\n- [https://celo.academy/t/exploring-alfajores-testnet-a-comprehensive-guide-to-celos-test-network/2618](https://celo.academy/t/exploring-alfajores-testnet-a-comprehensive-guide-to-celos-test-network/2618)\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- [https://github.com/celo-org/staked-celo/pull/211/files](https://github.com/celo-org/staked-celo/pull/211/files)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nCelo’s previous audit reports can be found here: [https://celo.org/audits](https://celo.org/audits)\n\nCelo’s is currently running an audit. Bugs in the audit report that aren't disclosed pre-launch are valid for rewards.",

  "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
