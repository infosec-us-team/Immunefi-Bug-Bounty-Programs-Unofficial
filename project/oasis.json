This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports and Critical/High/Medium severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, Critical/High severity bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nPreviously highlighted vulnerabilities in the following security reviews are considered as out-of-scope:\n  - [https://chainsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ChainSecurity_Oazo_Apps_Limited_Multiply_Smart-Contract-audit_-September-7th-2021.pdf](https://chainsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ChainSecurity_Oazo_Apps_Limited_Multiply_Smart-Contract-audit_-September-7th-2021.pdf) \n  - [https://chainsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ChainSecurity_Oazo_Apps_Limited_Multiply_FMM_extension_audit.pdf ](https://chainsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ChainSecurity_Oazo_Apps_Limited_Multiply_FMM_extension_audit.pdf)\n  - [https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/oasis-app-modular-proxy-actions/](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/oasis-app-modular-proxy-actions/)\n\nThe domain [https://legacy.oasis.app/](https://legacy.oasis.app/) is considered as out of scope of this program. \n\nOasis utilises third-party smart contracts and services (e.g. Maker Protocol, 1Inch, GUNI, etc.). The below rules apply to vulnerabilities in the underlying protocols and services:\n  - Only the smart contracts, websites and applications developed by the Oasis team are in the scope of this bug bounty program and are eligible for a reward. \n  - Vulnerabilities in the underlying protocols and services might be eligible for their dedicated bug bounty programs.\n  - The Oasis team will facilitate the communication related to the reported vulnerabilities in the underlying protocols and services.\n\nAt the moment the Oasis team is focusing on the new smart contract architecture, which utilizes actions within Operations to tie DeFi together.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports, and a maximum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Oasis__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
