This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, which primarily takes into consideration the funds at risk but also other factors at the discretion of the team. \n\nPayouts up to USD 250 000 are handled by __Primitive Finance__ directly and are denominated in USD.

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
