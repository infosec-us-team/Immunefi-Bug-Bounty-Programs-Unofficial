      "programOverview": "Primitive is an AMM launching in December on Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum One, and Optimism.  \n\nAdditional information on Primitive can be found at [https://primitive.finance](https://primitive.finance).\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly\nconcerned with the loss of user funds.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the\nfollowing types:\n\n**Smart Contracts/Blockchain:**\n\n- Re-entrancy\n- Logic errors\n  - Including user authentication errors\n- Solidity/EVM details not considered\n  - Including integer over-/under-flow\n  - Including unhandled exceptions\n- Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - Including composability vulnerabilities\n- Oracle failure/manipulation\n- Novel governance attacks\n- Economic/financial attacks\n  - Including flash loan attacks\n- Congestion and scalability\n  - Including running out of gas\n  - Including block stuffing\n  - Including susceptibility to frontrunning\n- Consensus failures\n- Cryptography problems\n  - Signature malleability\n  - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n  - Weak randomness\n  - Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System. This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, which primarily takes into consideration the funds at risk but also other factors at the discretion of the team. \n\nPayouts up to USD 250 000 are handled by __Primitive Finance__ directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.",
