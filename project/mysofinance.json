      "programOverview": "MYSO Finance is a DeFi protocol that allows users to borrow without liquidation risk through so called “Zero-Liquidation Loans” (also sometimes referred to as non-liquidatable loans), which are designed to make DeFi borrowing as easy as possible (i.e., users don’t need to worry about liquidations, health factor monitoring etc.) and at the same time meant to make them an attractive new yield source for lenders. In essence, Zero-Liquidation Loans function as a risk transfer mechanism, in which the borrowers are relieved from liquidation risk while lenders – by design – bear shortfall risk to earn yield for this. From the lender’s risk-return profile, this can be thought of as a physically settled covered call strategy. For more information about this, please see the [White Paper](https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/MYSO_v1_Core_A_Trust-Minimized_Protocol_for_Zero-Liquidation_Loans/21581328) or [Medium posts](https://medium.com/mysofinance) explaining this concept in more detail.\n\nMYSO Finance first started as a one of the finalists during the ETHOnline hackathon in October 2021 and is live on Ethereum Mainnet since beginning of 2023: see [https://app.myso.finance/](https://app.myso.finance/).\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the  [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 20 000 for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [https://chainsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ChainSecurity_MYSO_Finance_Core_Protocol_V1_audit_221018.pdf](https://chainsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ChainSecurity_MYSO_Finance_Core_Protocol_V1_audit_221018.pdf)\n\nMYSO Finance requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report for rewards of USD 20 000 and higher. The information needed is proof of identity and proof of address.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __MYSO Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.\n",
