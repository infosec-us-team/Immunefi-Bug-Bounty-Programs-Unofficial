      "programOverview": "The Eco Currency is intended to serve as a decentralized alternative to fiat currencies. Other cryptocurrencies either fix their monetary policies and admit exchange rate volatility, or attempt to limit volatility and achieve dollar parity through various policies.  \n\nEco does not treat dollar-parity as a proxy for utility. Eco is a free-floating currency designed to achieve its aims through monetary policy transparently established and managed by a representative group of governing “Trustees” who are elected by the community of Eco holders. Trustees have one core mandate: to maximize the wealth held in ECO. As with many other token systems, Eco currency holders are also empowered to vote on community proposals and protocol upgrades.\n\nEco features two tokens: the variable supply base currency (ECO), and a deflationary supply token (ECOx) intended to incentivize long-term holders and bootstrap an open market signaling expectations for ECO adoption. These tokens, together with the various contracts and components that support them, form the Eco Currency Protocol. \n\nThis bug bounty covers the following core components and peripherals:\n  - The core Eco Protocol contracts\n  - The ECO NFT and ECO Claim contracts\n  - All associated dApp\n    - ECO ID dApp\n    - ECO claim dApp\n\nFor more information about Eco, please visit [https://eco.org/](https://eco.org/).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward.
