Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, all Critical severity bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix to be considered for a reward. \n\nAll known issues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [https://github.com/symbiosis-finance/audits](https://github.com/symbiosis-finance/audits) \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Symbiosis__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
