      "programOverview": "Shadow Farm are strategies that allow users to earn boosted yields on dexes.\n\nShadow farms allow our users to stake their SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, and Beethoven-x LPs and earn their respective governance token. The strategies will harvest the rewards multiple times a day, and swap them for their respective yield-bearing version (xBOO, fBEETS, linSPIRIT) and stake them. A performance fee will be applied only on the compounded rewards. In some cases, like SpiritSwap, we hold their locked version (eg.: inSpirit) earning a boost yield on their farms.\n\nFor more information about Shadow Farm, please visit the [document page](https://docs.liquiddriver.finance/) or [Liquid Driver website](https://www.liquiddriver.finance/).
