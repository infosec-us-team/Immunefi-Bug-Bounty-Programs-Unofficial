All of the above is made possible by the Celer State Guardian Network (SGN), a tendermint PoS blockchain that acts as a messaging fabric interconnecting different blockchains. State Guardian Network acts as a sidechain on Ethereum with staking and governance functionality rooted in Ethereum. $CELR validators and delegators are rewarded in the system via block reward and part of the transaction fee generated by cBridge. \n\nFor more information about cBridge architecture, please visit \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and permanent freezing of any funds in liquidity pool smart contract or staking contracts\n  - Thefts and permanent freezing of unclaimed yield rewards\n  - The only web vulnerabilities in scope are those which lead directly and unequivocally to loss of user funds, a direct breach of data, and the deletion of site data\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nThere are some modifications from the above Severity Classification for this bug bounty program:\n\nCritical Level Security - Modified: \n  - Empty or permanent freeze the contract's holdings (e.g. economic attacks, flash loans, reentrancy, MEV, logic errors, integer over-/under-flow)\n\nMedium Level Security - Excluded: \n  - Griefing denial of service (i.e. attacker spends as much in gas as damage to the contract)\n  - Gas griefing\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. All High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. \nCritical Smart Contract and Blockchain bug reports are further capped at 10% of economic damage up to USD 2,000,000, which primarily takes into consideration the funds at risk but may include branding and PR aspects at the discretion of the team. However, they have a minimum reward of USD 150,000. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Previously known vulnerabilities (resolved or not) on the Ethereum network (and any other fork of these).\n  - Previously known vulnerabilities in Tendermint and or/any other fork of these.\n  - Previously known vulnerabilities in cosmos-sdk and or/any other fork of these.\n  - Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working Proof of Concept.\n  - Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.\n  - Public Zero-day vulnerabilities that have had an official patch for less than 1 month will be awarded on a case by case basis\n  - Any griefing attacks on the system or smart contract trying to spend gas costs or liquidity lockup to incur gas costs and computational overhead  for the validators and operators of the network.\n  - Liquidity value reduction or arbitraging incurred due to the pricing mechanisms of the system and LP’s own operations. \n  - Attacks involving getting access to privileged admin keys \n  - Delay of cross-chain transfer (fund security not compromised) due to network/rpc error from the blockchain endpoint being used by SGN validators\n  - Security issues related to connected blockchains of cBridge is not in the scope\n  - As to the current implementation, it is possible (with low probability) that a user triggered transaction (e.g., add liquidity, send fund, delegate stake) is not automatically synced to the sgn, or the sgn failed to automatically submit the fund relay transaction to the destination chain (e.g., due to chain rpc endpoint failure). Such cases do not introduce fund security, and can be recovered through manual CLI tools. Related improvements will be included in later releases.\n\nCeler Network requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is acquired through mutually agreed third-party KYC solutions. The collection of this information will be done by the Celer Network team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Celer Network__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __ETH__, __CELR__, __or a stablecoin__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.\n",
