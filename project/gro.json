      "programOverview": "G^2 (GSquared) is an upgraded version of Gro protocol- a stablecoin yield aggregator that tranches risk and yield. The revamped architecture simplifies the protocol by separating out previously interdependent logic into their own module contracts.\n\nInitially the protocol has two risk- and yield-tranched assets: the PWRD stablecoin and the Vault. All deposits are non-custodially allocated to a set of strategies. Depositors into the Vault receive a higher proportion of system yields but also take on extra smart contract and stable coin risk. \n\nInversely, the PWRD stablecoin receives a smaller portion of the system yield but is protected against these risks.\nThe protocol comprises of multiple smart contracts and modules, with multiple changes from the previous version of the protocol :\n\n  - The Vault and strategies have been moved out into their own stand alone module, __the GVault__ is responsible for generating yield on the by deploying the underlying asset into strategies. \n  - The share tokens from the GVault are __EIP-4626 compliant__\n  - A set of __keeper__ logic contract accompanies the GVault to allow for decentralized harvests and interactions with the vaults strategies\n  - Decentralized __stop loss logic__ has been implemented to automatic realization of losses in the vaults strategies\n  - The tranching logic has also been seperated out into its own stand alone module, the __GTranche__.\n  - The tranche acts as a wrapper for 4626 compatible tokens\n  - The GTranche then distributes yield between the two tranches based off of a modular yield sharing strategy defined in a plug-in contract\n\nThe first deployment of G^2 consists of a single asset vault (3Crv) which allows the protocol to support major stablecoins (DAI/USDC/USDT) without taking on pricing risk between the asset in different parts of the system. \nThe 4626 compatible token of this vault (G3Crv) will be wrapped in the tranche, which will implement a fixed yield distribution strategy for the Senior tranche. The GTranche is designed to be able to support multiple 4626 tokens, and is supported by a plug in generalized Relation Module contract, which allows the tranche to define a relationship between the underlying 4626 compatible tokens, enabling users to withdraw any token independent of which one they deposited.\n\nFor more information about Gro, please visit [https://gro.xyz/](https://www.gro.xyz/).\nFor more technical documentation, please visit [https://docs.gro.xyz/](https://docs.gro.xyz/)   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts, and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Thefts and/or freezing of principal funds in protocol of any amount\n  - Thefts and/or freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for X minutes/hours/days\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns\n  - Sets of protocol interactions which benefit the person making these interactions at the expense of other users invested in the protocol, or the protocol itself\n  - Protocol and/or oracle interactions which result in unfair allocation of gains to specific users",
