Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.  In addition, all bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [https://github.com/UnlockdFinance/unlockd/tree/mainnet/audits](https://github.com/UnlockdFinance/unlockd/tree/mainnet/audits)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Unlockd__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
