This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.  In addition, all bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [https://github.com/UnlockdFinance/unlockd/tree/mainnet/audits](https://github.com/UnlockdFinance/unlockd/tree/mainnet/audits)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Unlockd__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
