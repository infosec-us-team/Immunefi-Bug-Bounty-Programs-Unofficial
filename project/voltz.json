Voltz uses a Concentrated Liquidity Virtual AMM (vAMM) for price discovery only, with the management of the underlying assets performed by the Margin Engine. \n\nThe combined impact of these modules enables counterparties to create and trade fixed and variable rates through a mechanism that is up to 3,000x more capital efficient than alternative interest rate swap models, whilst also providing Liquidity Providers and Traders with significant control and flexibility over their positions.\n\nFor more information about Voltz, please visit [https://www.voltz.xyz/](https://www.voltz.xyz/).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll Critical/High severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nNote, the bounty amount for a critical submission is capped to be 10% of funds at risk. \n\nIssues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are considered as out of scope: \n  - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RDdZD5W26UhjY-GTCDcUpIJHaSJDko6EaUkpky62mYg/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RDdZD5W26UhjY-GTCDcUpIJHaSJDko6EaUkpky62mYg/edit#gid=0) \n  - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dcb5onZCRIFyCdt-1eun09qsjU-0LMK9/view?usp=sharing ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dcb5onZCRIFyCdt-1eun09qsjU-0LMK9/view?usp=sharing)\n\nSome additional bug reporting guidelines: \n  - Report a single vulnerability per submission, unless it is necessary to chain vulnerabilities to provide context regarding any of the issues.\n  - A reporter cannot be one of Voltzâ€™s current or former team members, vendors, contractors or an employee of any of those contractors or vendors.\n\nVoltz Protocol V1 has been audited and certified by Quantstamp, for additional information, go to [https://docs.voltz.xyz/security/audits](https://docs.voltz.xyz/security/audits).\n\nAll the issues discussed in the Quantstamp report certificate are considered out of scope of the Bug Bounty Program.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Voltz__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
