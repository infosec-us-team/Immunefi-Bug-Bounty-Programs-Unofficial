Here's how they work:\n\n**Before the Attackathon**<br/> Immunefi works with the project to host a security-focused education period, providing top tier education and support to security researchers.\n\n**During the Attackathon**<br/> Security researchers experience optimal hunting conditions, with direct project support, responsiveness, and duplicate rewards.\n\n**After the Attackathon**<br/> Immunefi spotlights the security accomplishments with a custom leaderboard, Attackathon Summary Report, Bugfix Reviews, and Individual Achievement Cards.\n\nUltimately, Attackathons serve to secure projects, develop their security ecosystem, and create new opportunities for security researchers."

Duplicate submissions of Insights are invalid.\n\nThe project commits to keeping private all info related to bug findings until this program is over. This means the project will not leak info about any bug findings or planned bug fixes, including bug findings found independently by the project or from concurrent private audits.\n\n__Insight Rewards Payment Terms__\n\n*Insight Rewards*: Portion of the Rewards Pool\n\n*The \"Insight\" severity was introduced on Boost (Audit Competitions) & Attackathon programs to recognize contributions that extend beyond identifying immediate vulnerabilities. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment. [View more information about Insights](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/13333032674961-Severity-Classification-System?utm_source=immunefi)\n\n**Duplicates of Insight reports are not eligible for a reward.**\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nFor this program, runnable PoC code is not required. Whitehats are instead required to write a step-by-step explanation of the PoC and impact.\nFor unclear reports or to resolve disputes Immunefi may still require a runnable PoC.Read more about it in [Audit Competition Proof-of-Concept Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/33260632501777-Audit-Competition-Proof-of-Concept-Rules)",

The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers are required to submit KYC within 14 days of KYC being requested, else their rewards may be forfeited. Immunefi may make exceptions due to extenuating circumstances.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\n- Whitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n   - Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\n- Immunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this Audit Competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\n- When there is uncertainty about how feasible an attack is Immunefi will use our feasibility limitation standards to determine the severity of the report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\n- By adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Plume Network has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",
