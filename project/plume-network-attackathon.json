The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers are required to submit KYC within 14 days of KYC being requested, else their rewards may be forfeited. Immunefi may make exceptions due to extenuating circumstances.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\n- Whitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n   - Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\n- Immunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this Audit Competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\n- When there is uncertainty about how feasible an attack is Immunefi will use our feasibility limitation standards to determine the severity of the report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\n- By adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Plume Network has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

Unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n**Public Disclosure of Known Issues**\n\nBug reports for publicly disclosed bugs are not eligible for a reward. \n- None\n\n**Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nNo – from the security-reviewer’s perspective this should be treated as a fresh, stand-alone system.\n\n**What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported?**\n\n- ERC-20 –\n     - The native stake/reward token $PLUME functions like an ERC-20 (plus an “ETH-style” 0xEeee… sentinel for native transfers).\n     - Any ERC-20 can be added as a reward token via addRewardToken.\n- No support for ERC-721, ERC-777, ERC-1155 in the staking contracts themselves.\n\n**What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?**\n\n- The bug requires privileged roles (TIMELOCK_ROLE / ADMIN_ROLE) to mis-configure a contract in a way that is already disallowed by policy.\n- The issue is a gas-optimisation or low-severity DOS that does not cause loss of funds or permanent unavailability.\n- Attacks that rely on an external system (e.g. the treasury implementation, oracle feeds, validators’ off-chain behaviour) operating maliciously within their allowed privileges.\n- Issues that only affect test / script code or out-of-scope directories.\n- Findings that depend on the administrator intentionally doing things.\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nThe addresses holding the following roles are considered trusted, and their actions, when performed within the defined capabilities of their roles, are out of scope:\n- ADMIN_ROLE / TIMELOCK_ROLE: The system's highest-level administrators.\n- VALIDATOR_ROLE: The role responsible for adding and removing validators from the set.\n- REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE: The role responsible for managing reward tokens and their emission rates.\n- l2AdminAddress (Validator Admin): The address that manages a specific validator's commission and other settings.\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nThe project has the following key external dependencies:\n- solidstate-solidity: Used for the core Diamond Proxy architecture.\n- @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable: Used for standard, secure, and upgradeable components like ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable and SafeERC20.\n\n**What are the most valuable educational resources already available?
