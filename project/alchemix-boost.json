Voting power is used to vote on snapshot proposals, on-chain governance of veALCX contracts, and gauge voting to direct ALCX emissions. veALCX users also earn a new ecosystem token called FLUX that allows for boosted gauge voting and early unlocks.  \n\nFor more information about Alchemix, please visit [https://alchemix.fi/](https://alchemix.fi/)\n\nAlchemix provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD.",

The size depends on the bugs found:\n- If no High or Critical severity bugs are found the reward pool will be **$75,000 USD**\n- If one or more High severity bugs are found the reward pool will be **$100,000 USD**\n- If one or more Critical severity bugs are found the reward pool will be **$125,000 USD**\n\nFor this boost, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward.\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi [Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Alchemix team directly and are denominated in USD.

      "assetsBodyV2": "__Asset Accuracy Assurance__\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n__Private Known Issues Reward Policy__\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward equal to that of a bug one severity lower.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nAlchemix commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Alchemix will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAlchemix adheres to the Primacy of Impact for all impacts.\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact). \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this boosted bug bounty and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Alchemix has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",
      "impactsBody": "__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.\n\n__Whitehat Educational Resources & Technical Info__\n\n- 1-year old medium article that is still largely correct: [https://alchemixfi.medium.com/vealcx-update-272e8900ac5a](https://alchemixfi.medium.com/vealcx-update-272e8900ac5a)\n- Draft document that will eventually turn into a governance proposal to explain and define the launch parameters: [https://alchemixdao.notion.site/veALCX-Launch-Parameters-Proposal-60113919e018424db7fc03c346c34386?pvs=4](https://alchemixdao.notion.site/veALCX-Launch-Parameters-Proposal-60113919e018424db7fc03c346c34386?pvs=4)\n\n__Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\nThis is a brand-new system to Alchemix, but is an upgrade of Velodromes veVELO (which is an upgrade of solidly’s vote-escrow system). The primary differences are:\n- Alchemix is not a DEX, and therefore sends a majority of ALCX to external locations such as incentives for 3rd party DEX pools, and vote incentives on platforms such as votium, votemarket, etc. Therefore, the system requires both external and internal gauges (ie, gauges that send ALCX to 3rd party and internal contracts). \n- Alchemix has introduced a “continuous max lock” boolean that may be enabled to prevent decay in voting power and remaining lock time (thus eliminating the need to manually re-lock a position constantly)\n- Alchemix has added the FLUX token, which is earned by veALCX lockers. Accrued FLUX credit can be burned to boost gauge voting power. Alternatively, credit can be burned to mint an ERC20 version of FLUX. The FLUX ERC20 is tradeable, and can be used to unlock a veALCX position early. The ERC20 can NOT be used to boost gauge voting power. \n- Alchemix has created a system by which any veALCX revenue asset can be whitelisted to be converted to alAssets to repay users’ debt so long as there is a direct swap path. Assets that are not whitelisted will be passed through directly to veALCX users. \n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs?__\n\n- **Which parts of the code are you most concerned about?**\n\nThe highest concern is in the accounting of bribes, including ensuring the total supply is tracked correctly. \n\n- **What attack vectors are you most concerned about?** \n\nAny attack that would artifically inflate a user’s claim on bribes, rewards, or a user’s voting power, or any other means by which bribes and rewards could be stolen.\n\n- **Which part(s) of the system do you want whitehats to attempt to break the most?**\n\nThe rewards distributor and voting system has the most complexity and handles bribes which could be a variety of assets as well as tracking voting\n\n- **Are there any assumed invariants that you want whitehats to attempt to break?**\n    - A user should never be able to claim more bribes than they have earned\n    - A user should never be able to claim more revenue than they have earned\n\t- A user should never be able to claim more rewards than they have earned\n\t- A user should never be able to vote with more power than they have\n\n\n__What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?__\n\nERC20, ERC721, ERC4626\n\n__What monitoring systems may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?__\n\nNone.\n\n__What Roles are there, and what capacities do they have?__\n\nusers - veALCX holders: can create new veALCX tokens, vote, claim bribes, claim rewards (ALCX), claim revenue, claim / burn / boost vote with FLUX\ndelegates - addresses veALCX holders approved to act on their behalf \nadmin - address (governance) that can update system state variables as needed\n\n__Which Roles are trusted roles and what privileges do they hold?__\n\nadmin - address (governance) that can update system state variables as needed.\n\n__Are there trusted roles for which you would consider any bugs invalid, even if the roles are not intended to have that capacity?__\n\nAny malicious behavior that an admin can execute is acknowledged and invalid since the assumption is that admin will be a trusted party\n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\n\nBalancer pool - 0xf16aEe6a71aF1A9Bc8F56975A4c2705ca7A782Bc\n\nAura pool - 0x8B227E3D50117E80a02cd0c67Cd6F89A8b7B46d7\n\nALCX/ETH price feed - 0x194a9AaF2e0b67c35915cD01101585A33Fe25CAa\n\n__Where might whitehats confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?__\n\nThe Balancer pool and Aura pools are out of scope and are acknowledged as a third-party pool integration. \n\nDependencies should be audited to verify they are being referenced and utilized correctly, but the dependencies themselves do not need to be audited (ie, it should be assumed the dependencies function as intended). For example, it should be assumed the Balancer Pool Token always represents 80% balance of ALCX and a 20% balance of ETH that tracks the initial deposit. \n\n__Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse whitehats?__\n\nVoting power decay over time. If a user does not update their vote their voting power remains constant, however, they will not be eligible for future bribes or FLUX earnings until they vote. This is considered when accounting for the distribution of Bribes in a given Epoch. \n\nRewards claiming with the Alchemists. If a user has an open debt position in an Alchemist (alETH, alUSD) they can claim revenue that pays off the debt in a given position, so long as that revenue asset is whitelisted to be swapped to the alAsset. \n\nAura rewards with ALCX-BPT. Deposits are sent to the Aura rewards pool when a user creates a veALCX position. VotingEscrow.sol accounts for this and manages the deposit and withdrawal when a user deposits or withdrawals from the VotingEscrow.sol contract. \n\nUsers can boost their vote only with unclaimed FLUX. Once FLUX has been claimed it can only be used to unlock a veALCX token early. It is intentional that it requires longer than the period their token is locked to accrue enough FLUX to unlock a veALCX position early. \n\n__What is the test suite setup information?__\n\n[https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/README.md)\n\n__Which chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed to?__\n\nETH Mainnet\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- Ambiguous Proposal Executions via the TimelockController are acknowledged and a part of the governance management system. \n- We are assuming that the price of the alAsset will always be at or below the price of the revenue token. This is currently a safe assumption since this imbalance has always held true for alUSD and alETH since their inception\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAlchemix’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YsO1t1-hSK1wkHajT_GAZ-u35O1Su74X/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YsO1t1-hSK1wkHajT_GAZ-u35O1Su74X/view?usp=sharing).

Users will lock 80/20 ALCX/ETH Balancer Liquidity Tokens into veALCX in exchange for voting power, ALCX emissions, and protocol revenue. Voting power is used to vote on snapshot proposals, on-chain governance of veALCX contracts, and gauge voting to direct ALCX emissions. veALCX users also earn a new ecosystem token called FLUX that allows for boosted gauge voting and early unlocks.",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
