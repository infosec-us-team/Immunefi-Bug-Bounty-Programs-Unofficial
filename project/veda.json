  "programOverview": "Veda is a DeFi vault primitive, which is a protocol-level mechanism for pricing, accounting, securing, optimizing, and automating capital. Designed to be non-custodial, trust-minimized, and composable, Veda empowers businesses, asset issuers, protocols, chains, wallets and applications to build enterprise-grade DeFi products without reinventing complex smart contract and offchain infrastructure.\n\nBy abstracting away the intricacies of cross-chain operations, yield optimization, and risk mitigation, Veda significantly lowers the barriers to entry for onchain finance for both consumer and institutional participants. Protocols integrating Veda can seamlessly onboard users with transparent safeguards in real time.\n\nVeda has demonstrated consistent market leadership in the vault and curation category. Notable achievements include:\n- Recognized as the largest vault provider and curator in DeFi, securing over $3 billion in TVL with over 100k users\n- Developed the BoringVault, the most widely used vault standard across DeFi\n- Onboarded the first vault token, eBTC, onto Aave's main market\n- Distributed in Binance Web3 wallet and ByBit Web3 wallet\n\nFor more information about Veda, please visit [https://veda.tech/](https://veda.tech/).\n\nVeda provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nVeda adheres to **Category 2: Notice Required** . This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nVeda adheres to the Primacy of Rules for all impacts\nhttps://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nVeda’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://docs.veda.tech/audits](https://docs.veda.tech/audits). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",

  "rewardsBody": "__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD  1 000 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 100 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n\"Funds directly affected” is narrowly defined as:\n\n(1) the funds held only in the specific smart-contract instance where the vulnerability exists;\n\n(2) Funds at risk of irreversible loss through exploitation, where the exploit is executable against the in-scope contracts as deployed on mainnet, using publicly available infrastructure and without requiring privileged access, protocol misconfiguration, or conditions not present at the time of submission.\n\nAnd expressly excludes:\n\n- funds in other contracts, vaults, strategies, or positions;\n- theoretical or maximum mathematical drainability;\n- impacts resulting from exploitation of external protocols or integrations outside of the defined scope\n- funds accessible only via MEV, timing manipulation, or reordering assumptions;\n- impacts dependent on liquidity movement or oracle price conditions.\n\nIf a vulnerability affects accounting, pricing, or internal state without placing funds at imminent risk of loss in a single transaction, the bug may be reclassified to High or Medium or Low severity based on Immunefi Feasibility Limitation standards, as defined in section below. \n\nThe minimum critical reward applies only where:\n\n(a) The vulnerability is exploitable against the in-scope contracts as deployed on mainnet. Multi-transaction or multi-block execution shall not diminish severity classification where the researcher demonstrates that the full attack path is executable without requiring external dependencies, privileged access, or conditions not present at time of submission.;\n(b) The researcher demonstrates exploitability against the in-scope contracts as deployed on mainnet. Assessment of feasibility and severity shall follow Immunefi's standard rules, including Feasibility Limitations.. \nIf these criteria are not met, the minimum reward does not apply.\n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward.. For avoidance of doubt, if mitigation is reasonably possible through pause, upgrade, parameter adjustment, or operational intervention, only the initial exploitable instance counts toward funds-at-risk.\n\n\nThe amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at 100% and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every [3600 blocks] the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down Cumulative reward calculations apply only where repeated exploitation is realistically feasible under normal adversarial conditions and does not require MEV, builder manipulation, extreme gas tactics, or non-standard environmental assumptions.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 10 000 to USD 25 000 with the reward calculated based on 100% of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward. \nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Veda team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
