      "programOverview": "Overlay enables markets on streams of data without the need for traditional counterparties or liquidity pools. The protocol accomplishes this through its native token, OVL.\n\nThe mechanism is relatively simple: Traders stake OVL as collateral on an Overlay market to enter a position on a particular stream. If the trade is profitable when the trader looks to unwind, the protocol mints more OVL to the circulating supply to compensate the trader for their gains. Conversely, if the trade is at a loss, the protocol burns OVL from the position’s staked collateral, removing the tokens from the circulating supply.\n\nFor more information about Overlay, please visit [https://overlay.market/](https://overlay.market/).",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nThe following issues are considered out of scope of this program: \n  - Economic oracle (time-weighted price and liquidity) manipulation \n  - System insolvency if due to economic factors / market movements \n\nIn addition, issues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [https://github.com/overlay-market/v1-core/blob/main/audits/spearbit/audit.pdf](https://github.com/overlay-market/v1-core/blob/main/audits/spearbit/audit.pdf) \n  - [https://github.com/overlay-market/v1-core/blob/main/audits/leastauthority/audit.pdf](https://github.com/overlay-market/v1-core/blob/main/audits/leastauthority/audit.pdf) \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Overlay__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
