Tetu's innovative solutions provide automated yield aggregation and distribution through xTETU.\n\nTetu's development focus is to build a self-sustaining yield management ecosystem that provides stable and attractive yields for users. Tetu aims to make the development of automated and decentralized Yield management solutions the main structure of the protocol.\n\nFor more information about Tetu, please visit [https://tetu.io/](https://tetu.io/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Theft of governance funds \n  - Governance activity disruption",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll critical smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC and a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into account the funds at risk. However, there is a minimum reward of 50 000 TETU tokens. Additionally, the maximum reward is capped at 1 000 000 TETU, even if 10% of the damage in USD equivalent is greater than the USD equivalent of 1 000 000 TETU. \n\nThe USD amounts provided in this bug bounty program is just an estimate of the equivalent USD value at the time of this publication. The rewards are only paid out in USDT. \n\nVulnerabilities that require moderator-approved access in order to be exploited will only receive a maximum of 20% of the advertised reward. For Critical Smart Contract and Blockchain vulnerability reports, this 20% is applied after the cap of 10% of economic damage.  \n\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Tetu__ team directly and are denominated in TETU.
