It aims at improving existing platforms by providing scalability and superior user experience to dApps and user functionalities.\n\nIt is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Polygon PoS supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.\nFor more information about Polygon Labs and Polygon protocols, please visit [https://polygon.technology/](https://polygon.technology/). \n\n__For Whitehats__: It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the Immunefi [Bug Report Template and Best Practices](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nPayouts over the lower bound reward are directly related to the direct funds at risk. If no funds are at risk, the Critical or High payouts are limited to the minimum, unless decided otherwise by Polygon Labs.\n\nFor the purposes of clarification, funds at risk refer to the proof of loss of funds.\n\nRewards for critical Blockchain/DLT and smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Polygon Labs team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in USDC or MATIC at the Polygon Labs teams' discretion. Polygon Labs commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nMATIC Payouts will be determined using TWAP 5 day price calculated from payment date.\n\nPolygon Labs requires an invoice to be received for each payout. An invoice template can be provided by Polygon Labs.\n\nThis bug bounty program is only open to individuals who reside outside of the countries that are restricted by OFAC and by UNSC resolutions. If the individual is a US person, tax information may be required in order to properly issue a 1099.\n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact). \n\nPolygon Labs requires an invoice to be received for each payout. An invoice template can be provided by Polygon Labs.\n\n__KYC Requirements__\n\nPolygon Labs does have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n| __KYC Info Required__     |\n| ---------- |\n| Wallet Address       |\n| Passport (for Critical payouts)       |\n| Place of residence (for Critical payouts)       |\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report which Polygon Labs determines in its sole discretion.",
