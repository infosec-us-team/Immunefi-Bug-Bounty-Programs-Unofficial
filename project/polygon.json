It aims at improving existing platforms by providing scalability and superior user experience to dApps and user functionalities.\n\nIt is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Polygon PoS supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.\nFor more information about Polygon Labs and Polygon protocols, please visit [https://polygon.technology/](https://polygon.technology/). \n\n__For Whitehats__: It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the Immunefi [Bug Report Template and Best Practices](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template).",

  "rewardsBody": "__Reward Distribution__\n\nPayouts over the lower bound reward are directly related to the direct funds at risk. If no funds are at risk, the Critical or High payouts are limited to the minimum, unless decided otherwise by Polygon Labs.\n\nFor the purposes of clarification, funds at risk refer to the proof of loss of funds.\n\nRewards for critical Blockchain/DLT and smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Polygon Labs team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in USDC or POL at the Polygon Labs teams' discretion. Polygon Labs commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nPOL Payouts will be determined using TWAP 5 day price calculated from payment date.\n\nPolygon Labs requires an invoice to be received for each payout. An invoice template can be provided by Polygon Labs.\n\nThis bug bounty program is only open to individuals who reside outside of the countries that are restricted by OFAC and by UNSC resolutions. If the individual is a US person, tax information may be required in order to properly issue a 1099.\n\nPolygon Labs requires an invoice to be received for each payout.

  "impactsBody": "Important notes:\n- You must be able to prove the real exploitability/severity of a report without doubt or assumptions, and based on the current state of the blockchain at the time of the report.\n- Reports are classified by Impact and Likelihood/Probability and using common frameworks such as CVSS. The combination determines the severity and are determined at Polygon’s sole discretion.\n- Actual reward amounts are determined at Polygon’s sole discretion. Factors influencing payout include report quality, completeness, and severity/exploitability.\n\n__Severity Table__\n\nReports are classified using two dimensions: Impact and Probability (Likelihood) and classified using the following table\n\n|                    | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |\n|--------------------|------------|----------------|--------------|\n| **High Probability**   | MEDIUM     | HIGH           | CRITICAL     |\n| **Medium Probability** | LOW        | MEDIUM         | HIGH         |\n| **Low Probability**    | LOW        | LOW            | MEDIUM       |\n\n__Understanding Probability__\n\nReports are classified using two dimensions: Impact and Probability (Likelihood). Probability reflects how permissionless and reliably the issue can be exploited against the current production deployment. Critical severity requires both High Impact and High Probability (i.e., a permissionless exploit that can be executed at will).\n\nHigh Probability\n- Permissionless: no privileged role/allowlist or compromised keys required.\n- Exploitable at will on production (reliable/repeatable under normal conditions).\n\nMedium Probability\n- Exploitable, but requires realistic preconditions (e.g., specific state/timing, meaningful capital/positioning, or common MEV/order-dependence).\n- May not succeed every attempt; depends on conditions outside the attacker's full control.\n\nLow Probability\n\n- Requires rare edge conditions or strong assumptions (e.g., very narrow timing, unlikely state/user behavior).\n- Hard to reproduce reliably / low success rate in practice.\n\n__Impacts to other assets__ \n\nHackers are encouraged to submit issues outside of those outlined Impacts and Assets in Scope. \n\nIf Whitehats can demonstrate a critical impact of code in production for an asset not in scope, Polygon Labs encourages you to submit your bug report using the “primacy of impact exception” asset as outlined below.",
