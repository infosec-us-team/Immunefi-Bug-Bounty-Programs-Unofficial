Specific repositories that contain in-scope assets are listed in the table below. Primary areas of concern are anything that causes loss of user funds or frozen funds from a smart contract hack. Note that not all contracts in these repositories are deployed and in active use by the protocol. Only contracts in active use are within the scope of the bug bounty.\n\nHarvest Finance is secondarily interested in securing its website, which can be found at https://harvest.finance/. Web vulnerability disclosures will be rewarded at a lower rate, relative to smart contract vulnerability disclosures.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on\nthe [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System](/severity-system/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from the consequence of exploitation to the privilege required to the likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nThe final reward amount for critical smart contract bugs is capped at 10% of \neconomic damage based on the vulnerability reported with a minimum payout of \n**USD 50 000**.\n\nTheft of yield/interest is considered as Medium for this bug bounty program.\n\nAll smart contract reports must include a PoC to be accepted. The PoC should provide clear proof of the vulnerability in a locally forked blockchain environment. All bug reports without a PoC will be rejected and require the submitter to resubmit with a PoC. \n\nThe following table is used for the classification of web and app bug reports. In the event of conflict with the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System, the classification on this table will be what is considered.\n\n| Severity | Vulnerability |\n| :-- | :-: |\n| **Critical** | Deletion of site data, XSS/CSRF, ACE |\n| **High** | Denial of Service, DoS ampliciation |\n| **Medium** | Incorrect modification of user data, leaking user data |\n\nAll web and app bug reports must include a PoC to be accepted. All web and app bug reports without a PoC will be rejected and require the submitter to resubmit with a PoC. \n\nVulnerabilities that require moderator-approved access to be exploited will only receive a maximum of 20% of the advertised reward. For Critical Smart Contract and Blockchain vulnerability reports, this 20% is applied after the cap of 10% of economic damage.  \n\nPayouts are handled by the **Harvest Finance** team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts up to **USD 100 000** are paid in **USDC**.",
