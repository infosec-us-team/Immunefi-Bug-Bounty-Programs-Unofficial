Primary areas of concern are anything that causes loss of user funds or frozen funds from a smart contract hack. Note that not all contracts in these repositories are deployed and in active use by the protocol. Only contracts in active use are within the scope of the bug bounty.\n\nHarvest Finance is secondarily interested in securing their website, which \ncan be found at [https://harvest.finance](https://harvest.finance/). Web vulnerability disclosures will be rewarded at a lower rate, relative to smart \ncontract vulnerability disclosures.",

In the event of conflict with the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System, the classification on this table will be what is considered.\n\n| Severity | Vulnerability |\n| :-- | :-: |\n| **Critical** | Deletion of site data, XSS/CSRF, ACE |\n| **High** | Denial of Service, DoS ampliciation |\n| **Medium** | Incorrect modification of user data, leaking user data |\n\nAll web and app bug reports must include a PoC in order to be accepted. All web and app bug reports without a PoC will be rejected and require the submitter to resubmit with a PoC. \n\nVulnerabilities that require moderator-approved access in order to be exploited will only receive a maximum of 20% of the advertised reward. For Critical Smart Contract and Blockchain vulnerability reports, this 20% is applied after the cap of 10% of economic damage.  \n\nPayouts are handled by the **Harvest Finance** team directly and are denominated in USD.
