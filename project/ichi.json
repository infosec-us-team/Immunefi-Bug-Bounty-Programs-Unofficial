It is hard capped at 5M tokens.  Each ICHI is a vote on allowed oracles, collateral, investment strategies, etc in exchange for protocol governance rewards.\n\noneTokens are the governance tokens of specific oneToken systems.  Each oneToken is a vote on treasury allocations, specific stablecoins parameters (like minting and redeeming fees), and on adoption programs.\n\nMore information about Ichi can be found on their website, [https://www.ichi.org/](https://www.ichi.org/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards for Smart Contract vulnerabilities are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __ICHI__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ for rewards up to __USD 10 000__. For payouts greater, the reward is paid in __xICHI__. Critical payouts are done over a 6-month period distributed every month with the utilization of a Sablier contract",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
