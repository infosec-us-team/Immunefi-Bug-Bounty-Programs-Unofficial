      "programOverview": "ICHI is a self-sustaining, community governed platform that enables any other cryptocurrency community to create and govern their own in-house, non-custodial oneToken (a stablecoin valued at $1). \n\nICHI is the governance token of the ichi.org community and platform. It is hard capped at 5M tokens.  Each ICHI is a vote on allowed oracles, collateral, investment strategies, etc in exchange for protocol governance rewards.\n\noneTokens are the governance tokens of specific oneToken systems.  Each oneToken is a vote on treasury allocations, specific stablecoins parameters (like minting and redeeming fees), and on adoption programs.\n\nMore information about Ichi can be found on their website, [https://www.ichi.org/](https://www.ichi.org/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Solidity/EVM details not considered\n    - including integer over-/under-flow\n    - including unhandled exceptions\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n    - including composability vulnerabilities\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n  - Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n  - Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards for Smart Contract vulnerabilities are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __ICHI__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ for rewards up to __USD 10 000__. For payouts greater, the reward is paid in __xICHI__. Critical payouts are done over a 6-month period distributed every month with the utilization of a Sablier contract",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n  - Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n  - Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n  - Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n    - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n  - Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n  - Lack of liquidity\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Sybil attacks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n  - Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n  - Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n  - Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n  - Any denial of service attacks\n  - Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n  - Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",
