It is hard capped at 5M tokens.  Each ICHI is a vote on allowed oracles, collateral, investment strategies, etc in exchange for protocol governance rewards.\n\noneTokens are the governance tokens of specific oneToken systems.  Each oneToken is a vote on treasury allocations, specific stablecoins parameters (like minting and redeeming fees), and on adoption programs.\n\nMore information about Ichi can be found on their website, [https://www.ichi.org/](https://www.ichi.org/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.",

However, payouts are done in __USDC__ for rewards up to __USD 10 000__. For payouts greater, the reward is paid in __xICHI__.
