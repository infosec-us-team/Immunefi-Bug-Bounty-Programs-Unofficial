For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nTimeless and Bunni adheres to category 1. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nTimeless and Bunni adhere to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nTimeless and Bunni commit to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Timeless and Bunni will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Invoicing Information__\n\nIf needed by the security researcher, Timeless and Bunni are able to provide the necessary information for the proper issuance of an invoice. This includes:\n- Timeless’ legal entity name\n- Timeless’ registered address\n- Timeless’ email to send the invoice\n",

      "rewardsBody": "__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 250,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 69,420 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 100% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 25,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 5 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 5 blocks and then a third at 10 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 75% and 50% of the reward from the first attack, respectively.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities will be capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles for every additional 5 blocks that the funds or NFTs could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5, up to the hard cap of USD 25,000. However, a minimum reward of USD 10,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Previous Audits__\n\n- [https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/08-2022-Bunni/ ](https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/08-2022-Bunni/)\n- [https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/03-2022-Bunni-Zap/ ](https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/03-2022-Bunni-Zap/)\n- [https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/08-2022-Timeless-Yield-Daddy/ ](https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/08-2022-Timeless-Yield-Daddy/)\n- [https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/Timeless-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/Timeless-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf) \n\nTimeless and Bunni have provided these completed audit review reports for reference.
