For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n- Bug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n- The reward calculation using a round-up/down in compute_commission_amount_rounded_down and compute_commission_amount_rounded_up under utils.cairo\n- There is a set_reward_supplier function in addition to having it in the consructor. This is a non-issue.\n- The used token is STRK and is trusted, reentrency vulnerabilities regarding the token are a non-issue\n- All relevant contracts, i.e. Staking, RewardSupplier, MintingCurve, Pool contracts,  are all ours and trusted. Reentrency vulnerabilities in interactions between these contracts (again, including all different pool instances), are a non-issue.\n- In case of commision change on stakers, pool members will not get the updated comission automatically. All issues regarding this phenomenon are known.\n- Users can not switch out of finalized pool if they hadn’t made an exit intent prior to the staker’s unstake_action.\n- In PeriodMintLimit.sol the periodic mint cap is an interval (and not sliding window), and is reset on timestamp rounded week, so potentially someone can mint double the mint cap in 2 seconds (the one before end of week, and one after). This is a non-issue.\n- Out of order messages to `update_total_supply` are a non-issue.",
