Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n- [https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/issues ](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/issues)\n- Issues that cannot be reproduced on networks configured and currently run by Gear, (i.e.: Gear Test Network V6, Vara Network). Severity of issues that point out problems with the code and can _theoretically_ affect the above network list will be considered individually.\n\nGear requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed are Passport and Utility Bill.
