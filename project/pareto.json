Its infrastructure emphasizes transparency, automation, and flexibility. Credit Vaults are the core primitive: they eliminate utilization-based inefficiencies, reduce operational overhead, and improve capital efficiency for both lenders and borrowers.\n\nCurrently, Pareto Credit product suite includes: :\n- Credit Vaults  a suite of smart contracts built to simplify on-chain lending and credit position management for borrowers and lenders. They provide the infrastructure for real-world financing, making it more transparent and efficient.\n- USP: a synthetic dollar protocol backed by real-world institutional-grade private credit, alongside a globally accessible savings asset, sUSP.\n\nPayouts are handled by Pareto Credit directly and are denominated in USD, payouts are done in stablecoins.",
