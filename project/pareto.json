Its infrastructure emphasizes transparency, automation, and flexibility. Credit Vaults are the core primitive: they eliminate utilization-based inefficiencies, reduce operational overhead, and improve capital efficiency for both lenders and borrowers.\n\nCurrently, Pareto Credit product suite includes: :\n- Credit Vaults  a suite of smart contracts built to simplify on-chain lending and credit position management for borrowers and lenders. They provide the infrastructure for real-world financing, making it more transparent and efficient.\n- USP: a synthetic dollar protocol backed by real-world institutional-grade private credit, alongside a globally accessible savings asset, sUSP.\n\nPayouts are handled by Pareto Credit directly and are denominated in USD, payouts are done in stablecoins.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System 2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nThe final reward for critical bounty payouts is capped at 10% of the funds at risk based on the vulnerability reported.\n\nPoC is required for all levels.\n\nTheft of yield or interest is considered as Medium but may be considered High depending on the amount of funds at risk.\n\nBest practices critiques are not accepted under this program. \n\nThe likelihood of exploitability is also taken into consideration in the\ndetermination of the final payout amount based on the severity of the bug\nreported according to the table below:\n\n| | Medium | High | Critical |\n|  :-- | :-- | :-- | :-: |\n| Almost Certain | $5,000 | $20,000 | $50,000 |\n| Likely | $3,000 | $10,000 | $25,000 | \n| Possible | $1,000 | $5,000 | $10,000 |\n| Unlikely  | $500 | $1,000 | $5,000 |\n| Almost Possible | $100 | $500 | $1,000 |\n\nPayouts are handled by **Idle Finance** governance directly and are denominated\nin **USD**.
