  "programOverview": "Yelay allows banks, fintech, funds, exchanges, custodians, treasuries, launchpools, DefAI projects and other builders to earn DeFi returns in a fully composable manner. \n\nBy removing the complexity of setting up and managing DeFi portfolios, Yelay partners can deploy capital, with a single deposit, in diversified yield-generating strategies, as easy as investing in an ETF. \n\nPortfolios are auto-rebalanced and capital is automatically compounded. Yelay minimizes transaction costs, optimizes DeFi yields and brings DeFi risk management to the next level. \n\nWith Yelay, you get the most out of the DeFi market and can offer superior yield opportunities to your client base, as a cost-free white-labeled solution. Yield for the World. Fuel for DeFi.\n\nFor more information about Yelay, please visit [https://www.yelay.io/](https://www.yelay.io/).\n\nYelay provides rewards in __USDC__, denominated in __USD__. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nYelay will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n  - Full name \n  - Date of birth\n  - Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n  - Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nYelay adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n  - Smart Contracts: Critical\n  - Smart Contracts: High\n  - Smart Contracts: Medium\n  - Smart Contracts: Low\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nYelay commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Yelay will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nYelay V3's completed audit reports can be found here:\n  -[https://github.com/YieldLayer/yelay-lite/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/YieldLayer/yelay-lite/tree/main/audits)\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, yelay has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 150 000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 20 000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n - If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n  - For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n - High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.   \n\n  - In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __yelay__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __USDC__.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",

Such users are simply filtered out from offchain yield calculations.”\n- Use of malicious strategies or those which are not fit for the purpose.
