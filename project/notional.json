      "programOverview": "Notional is a protocol on Ethereum that facilitates fixed-rate, fixed-term crypto asset lending and borrowing through a novel financial instrument called fCash.\n\nfCash is a tokenized representation of a fCash flow. It represents the amount of tokens (i.e. Dai) that an account is either entitled to receive or obligated to pay at its designated maturity. For example, if an account holds +100 fCash tokens for a maturity on January 1, 2021, it is entitled to 100 Dai at any time greater than or equal to January 1, 2021. Similarly, -100 fCash tokens for the same maturity means that the account is obligated to pay 100 Dai at maturity.\n\nFor more information about Notional, please visit [https://notional.finance/](https://notional.finance/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Loss of funds \n  - Voting manipulation\n  - Any function that is outside the intended behavior of the smart contracts\n  - Redirection of funds\n  - Injection of text",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nMedium and low smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are paid at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on funds at risk. The team may, at its discretion, take into consideration other aspects such as PR and branding effects. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\n__KYC__\n\nNotional rewards both foreigners and USA nationals:\n  - Foreigners must complete the W-8BEN, which is IRS mandated \n  - USA nationals must complete the W9\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Notional__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__, __DAI__, __ETH__, __USDT__, or the project token, at the discretion of the team.",
