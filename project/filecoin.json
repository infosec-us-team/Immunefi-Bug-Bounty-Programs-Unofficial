For more information about the FVM, visit https://fvm.dev.\n\nFor Whitehats: It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. \n\n__Note:__ The program is subject to all terms and conditions of this Bug Bounty Policy (”Policy”), and all submissions to this Program are governed by this Policy. \n\nBy submitting a vulnerability through this Program you are agreeing to the Policy.   \n\nFilecoin provides rewards in USD/USDC at the Filecoin Foundation’s sole discretion.For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__\n\nThe Filecoin Security Team, which consists of core developers and contributors, evaluates the significance of reported vulnerabilities and the appropriate bounty award, if any, in its sole discretion. The Filecoin Security Team may also at its sole discretion increase the award, within the ranges above, for vulnerability reports that include quality written descriptions, test code, scripts and detailed instructions, and well-documented fixes.\n\nPayouts are handled by the Filecoin Foundation directly and are denominated in USD/USDC at the Filecoin Foundation’s sole discretion. Payouts will be distributed according to the terms set out in this Policy at the time of report submission.\n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Rules program.

Invoices will generally be paid on a net 30 basis, after the \nFilecoin Foundation has received all necessary information from the researcher, such as wallet details and KYC information. Any taxes and other costs associated with award acceptance are the sole responsibility of the award recipient. The researcher is responsible for resolving any local restrictions or requirements related to the award under the reporter’s local laws.\n\n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nFilecoin will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Country of residence\n- For US citizens: W9, W8BEN, or W8BENE forms, and any other forms reasonably requested by the Filecoin Foundation\n\nNote: KYC information is required only following confirmation of the validity of a bug report and bounty amount is decided, if any. \n\n__Eligibility Criteria__ \n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n- Subject to sanctions administered by U.S. OFAC or any other office or department of the United States\n- Current and former members of the Filecoin core development team, and current and former employees, contractors, and any others who have been paid (directly or indirectly) by Protocol Labs or the Filecoin Foundation to work on the Filecoin project, are not eligible for bug bounty rewards under this Program.\n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in audit review(s).\n\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nFilecoin adheres to category 1 - Transparent. Whitehats are allowed to disclose information about their fixed and paid bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication page.](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/)\n\nPublic disclosure of the vulnerability must conform with the Coordinated Disclosure Policy. The CDP is subject to change at any time. \n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nFilecoin adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the[ Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__Report Quality__\n\nReports must be thorough and contain enough information that Filecoin Security Team can easily duplicate any findings. If specially-crafted files are required they should be submitted as attachments. Screenshots are encouraged while videos are discouraged, unless necessary. Submissions should not consist solely of a video.\n\nReports are welcome for issues that cannot be proven but still suggest a serious impact. Filecoin trusts researchers to make that determination and we will assist in clarifying impact and adjusting the severity as needed. It is encouraged to report a vulnerability early while Filecoin will help to determine the impact rather than waiting days or weeks to create a proof. \n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nFilecoin commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Filecoin will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n__Description of known issue/repository__\n\nAll issues, PRs and code comments that are already mentioned and listed in the In-Scope Assets - Related Impact-in-Scope: Issues created in the following repos:\n- https://github.com/filecoin-project/ https://github.com/ipfs/ \n- https://github.com/whyrusleeping/cbor-gen \n- https://github.com/lurklab/neptune/ https://github.com/lurklab/trition\n\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nFilecoins’s completed audit reports can be found in Spec at https://spec.filecoin.io/. Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional actions and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Filecoin has satisfied the requirements for the[ Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209)",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the[ Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward $150,000 . However, a minimum reward of USD $100,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nAll rewards for this Program are scaled based on a set of criteria, taking into account factors like: ease of exploitation of the bug, impact of the bug, likelihood of the vulnerability (particularly for bug reports where the vulnerability would require multiple conditions to be met), and report quality.\n\nReported security vulnerabilities will be eligible for a bounty amount based on severity, calculated based on its impact and likelihood using the OWASP Risk Rating model (https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).",

Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: \n1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and/or \n2) zero payout.\n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited:\n\n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against Filecoin Foundation, storage providers, Filecoin project contributors, ecosystem collaborators, or community members.\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Active exploits against the Filecoin network or Filecoin miners and nodes\n- Physical or electronic attempts to access offices where project contributors work or data centers where Filecoin nodes are located\n- Violating the privacy of Filecoin users and community members, compromising or disrupting their systems, destroying data, stealing funds and/or harming the user experience.
