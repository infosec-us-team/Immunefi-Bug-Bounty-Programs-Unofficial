  "rewardsBody": "__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward USD $200,000. However, a minimum reward of USD USD $40,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown) - [50,000 USD] \n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork) - [50,000 USD] \n- For critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk, which includes all affected projects on top of the respective blockchain/DLT, and the market cap according to the average between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com, calculated at the time the bug report is submitted. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high Blockchain/DLT non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Unintended chain split (network partition) - [20,000 USD]\n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by reducing number of blocks produced in an hour to be less than 60. I.e. average block time > 60s. - [10,000 USD] \n- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters - [10,000 USD]\n- RPC API crash affecting projects with greater than or equal to 25% of the market capitalization on top of the respective layer - [10,000 USD]\n\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Acala team directly in crypto tokens of their choices, valued at the US dollar market rates, e.g. DOT, ACA, USDT, USDC. \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
