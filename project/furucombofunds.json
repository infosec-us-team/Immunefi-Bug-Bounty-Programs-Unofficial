Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - All vulnerabilities found in [https://github.com/dinngodev/furucombo-funds-contract/tree/master/audit](https://github.com/dinngodev/furucombo-funds-contract/tree/master/audit)\n  - All valid bug reports submitted to Furucombo bug bounty ([https://immunefi.com/bounty/furucombo/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/furucombo/))\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Furucombo Funds__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
