The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers are required to submit KYC within 14 days of KYC being requested, else their rewards may be forfeited.

Which are not?**\n\nSIP10 is the only token standard supported https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md \n\n**What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?**\n\nDeposit processing can be paused by shutting down the Emily API server. In the case of vulnerabilities in deposit handling, this can be used to reduce the impact of an ongoing attack.\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nSigners are permissioned and whitelisted operators. Any attack that requires a majority of signers to be malicious should be out of scope. Attacks that require a minority of signers to be malicious would still be in scope but with reduced severity. \n\n**Which chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?**\n\nStacks L2\n\n**Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nThis attackaton focuses on sBTC V1, which adds (wrt previous attackathon for version 0.9) the ability to withdraw sBTC back into Bitcoin (on the L1). \n\nThe main differences include:\n\n- The new code related to withdrawals;\n- all existing code (including the previous code related to deposits);\n- key rotation, which allows the signer set to agree on a new aggregate key and start using it;\n- the WSTS cryptographic library that powers threshold signature on Bitcoin.\n\nCode until https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc/releases/tag/0.0.9-rc7.1  is related to deposits. Anything more recent is related to withdrawals.\n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs?**\n\nThe end-to-end flow of processing new Bitcoin deposits and minting sBTC on Stacks is relatively complex and error prone. Issues here could allow DoS of valid deposits or incorrect minting/burning of unbacked sBTC.\n\nVulnerabilities in the sBTC smart contracts hosted on Stacks could break the core assumptions of the system. Any attack that leads to a mismatch between the BTC collateral and the sBTC would be highly interesting to us.\n\nAny attacks against the threshold signature scheme used on Bitcoin\n\n**Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\nVulnerabilities in the Stacks L2 blockchain itself should be reported directly to the [Stacks Immunefi bug bounty](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/stacks/information/).",

      "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
