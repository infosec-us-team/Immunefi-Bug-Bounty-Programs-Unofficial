      "programOverview": "ICON is an open-source layer 1 delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchain and smart contract platform focused on connecting unique blockchains and their respective communities. ICON’s Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP) is a trustless and chain-agnostic interoperability solution that supports generic smart contract calls between connected blockchains. ICON offers a unique high-performance smart contract execution environment powered by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is ideal for developing minimal-latency cross-chain dApps. The ICON blockchain is governed by validators elected through the network’s ICX staking and delegation mechanism.\n\nFor more information about ICON, please visit [https://www.icon.foundation/](https://www.icon.foundation/) and [https://build.icon.foundation/](https://build.icon.foundation/).",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nICON requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. If the entity is an individual, the information needed are Name, Address, Nationality, Birthday, copy of ID card, copy of residence certificate, criminal records and personal relations with politicians.\nIf the entity is a company, business start date, address, country the business base on, copy of business certificate. And some information about people who have over 20% of the company's share. The collection of this information will be done by the ICON project team.\n\nTo determine the final reward amount, the likelihood to have a meaningful impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds is considered. The final decision on the payout amount will be determined by the ICON team at its discretion.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __ICON__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __ICX__. If you disagree with the KYC requirement or you are denied by the KYC process, payouts cannot be done.",
