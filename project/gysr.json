The platform allows anyone to configure and launch a staking pool with zero code.\n\nFor more information about GYSR, along with whitepapers and security audit reports, please visit [https://www.gysr.io/](https://www.gysr.io/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their core smart contracts and on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Logical errors or miscalculation that result in incorrect accounting or yield amount\n  - Unexpected and unfair manipulation of incentive mechanisms",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll Medium, High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. All Low Smart Contract bug reports require a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __GYSR__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC and ETH__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.",
