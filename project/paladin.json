      "programOverview": "Paladin is a decentralized, non-custodial governance lending protocol where users can either loan the voting power in their governance token, or borrow some voting power.\n\nDepositors stake governance tokens or derivatives that grant voting power in exchange for yield, while borrowers can leverage their voting power to gain more influence temporarily. \n\nPaladin is a work in progress currently on the Kovan testnet. Once the platform is on mainnet, this bug bounty program will be updated.\n\nFor more information about Paladin, please visit [https://www.paladin.vote/](https://www.paladin.vote/). \n\nThe bug bounty program covers its smart contracts and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Override of smart contracts ownership",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC and a suggestion for a fix. \n\nThis bug bounty program has a total initial budget of USD 75 000. If there are bug reports received over a short span of time that are validated, the rewards are distributed on a first-come-first-served basis. Afterwards, the bug bounty program will be paused until mid-october 2021 at the latest and rewards will be distributed then.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Paladin__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in __USDC__.",
