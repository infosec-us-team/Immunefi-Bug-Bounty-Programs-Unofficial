Wormhole NTT is a framework for transferring tokens across blockchains without liquidity pools. Unlike traditional wrapped assets, NTT maintains your token's native properties on every chain. This ensures that you retain complete control over crucial aspects, such as metadata, ownership, upgradeability, and custom features. \n\nFor more information about Folks Finance and their existing products, please visit https://folks.finance.",

That means that even if 1 Low severity bug is found, the whole reward pool is unlocked and has to be fully distributed between security researchers. \n\nIf not a single bug is found (Insights do not count as bugs) the reward pool is **$4,500 USD**.\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid and unlock the corresponding reward pool.\n\n**Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements**\nA **runnable PoC**, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)",

Unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n**Public Disclosure of Known Issues**\n\n- Bug reports for publicly disclosed bugs are not eligible for a reward. \n- The Algorand Wormhole NTT implementation doesn’t have the exact same behaviour/specification as the EVM/Solana/Sui Wormhole NTT implementation. \n- There is no support for the NTT Global Accountant.\n- There is no support for “additional payload” in NttManager.\n- There is no support for automatic relaying in WormholeTransceiver.\n- It is the responsibility of the integrator to prevent overflow risk in TrimmedAmount by setting appropriate decimals.\n- It is the responsibility of the integrator to set an appropriate threshold for attestations in the NttManager.\n- It is the responsibility of the integrator to set appropriate rate limits in the NttManager.\n- It is the responsibility of the integrator to add and manage appropriately the configured Transceivers e.g. consider the foreign reference limitations, opcode costs etc. \n- An ASA may have their clawback/freeze set.\n- The NttToken, NttTokenNew and NttTokenExisting are provided as reference implementations. A project is able to implement their own concrete INttToken if needed to fit their custom needs.\n- In general, Wormhole NTT is a framework so if X behaviour is not supported then integrators are recommended to modify the smart contracts for themselves.\n- Opcode optimisation when prioritising clean and readable code.\n- Not checking for rekey and close-to\n- Some box storage cannot be deleted\n- Box MBR funding is implicitly required\n- Some box storage costs are not refunded after box deletion\n- Block timestamp manipulation by block proposer\n\n\n**Private Known Issues Reward Policy**\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\nAlthough the smart contract code for all the following is out-of-scope, their impact and how they are used is in scope. Namely, on other chains, the Wormhole NTT implementation. On Algorand, the Wormhole Core smart contract, VaaVerify logic signature and TmplSig logic signature. \nIf the rate limit is exceeded, the transfer is only delayed from completing. This is the intended design as it follows the equivalent EVM implementation. \n\n\n**Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nIt’s an extension to the existing Wormhole NTT framework, adding support for Algorand. The main differences between the Algorand and EVM implementation for Wormhole NTT is the introduction of a generic MessageHandler and a global TransceiverManager. \n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs and/or what attack vectors are you most concerned about?**\n\nAssumptions made about the compiled TEAL code when in reality it does something else. You can view what the Algorand Python compiles into by looking at the build folder generated named “specs/teal”.\n\nReplay attacks where you can receive or execute the same message multiple times.\n\n**What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported?**\n\nAlgorand Standard Assets (ASAs)\n\n**What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?**\n\nThe integrator has the ability to pause certain functionality in the NttManager and TransceiverManager. A rate limit can be configured for outbound and inbound transfer amounts. Configured Transceivers can be removed and added.\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nIn the NttManager: default admin, upgradeable admin, ntt manager admin. In the NttTokenNew and NttTokenExisting: default admin, upgradeable admin. In the TransceiverManager: message handler admin. In the WormholeTransceiver: default admin, upgradeable admin, manager. \n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nNone\n\n**Which chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?**\n\nAlgorand\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\n- Algorand smart contract library https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algorand-smart-contract-library. \n- The Wormhole NTT implementation on other chains https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers. \n- The Wormhole Core implementation on Algorand https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/algorand. \n\n**Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?**\n\nThe external dependency of the Wormhole Core implementation on Algorand https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/algorand was written a long time ago so uses old outdated standards for Algorand development. \n\n**What are the most valuable educational resources already available? (Ie. Documentation, Explainer videos or articles, etc)**\n\n- Algorand NTT Design - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eli_csvdUgOrrE75dbtoSZQDxv-zAjZyBo61wyaN7jQ/edit?usp=sharing \n- Wormhole NTT explainer video https://youtu.be/Od5cTaxjTiw?si=WtT5MzZvrGMEwMrZ \n- Wormhole NTT Docs - https://wormhole.com/docs/products/token-transfers/native-token-transfers/overview/ \n- Algorand Python Docs - https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya/ \n- Algorand Developer Portal - https://dev.algorand.co/",
