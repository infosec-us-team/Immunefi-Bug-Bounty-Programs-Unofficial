      "programOverview": "Kiln On-Chain (v1) enables non-custodial platforms to propose an ETH staking offer where users can stake on dedicated validators while remaining the only one able to access their staked assets. \n\nThe goal of these Ethereum Smart Contracts is to enable:\n- Operator to register its validation keys deposit data on the Smart Contract\n- Users to deposit on approved and available validation keys\n- Manage the Execution and Consensus Layer rewards and exited ETH\n- Perform the commission dispatching on these ETH when user performs a withdrawal action\n\nThis Bug Bounty is focused on the Staking Smart Contracts only, all items regarding dApps or validation infrastructure are out of scope. \n\nFor more information about Kiln On-Chain, please visit [https://www.kiln.fi/](https://www.kiln.fi/)\n\nKiln provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n- If the claim comes from an individual:\n   - The first names, surnames, date and place of birth of the person concerned\n   - A Valid ID\n- If the claim comes from a business:\n   - Legal form, name, registration number and address of the registered office\n   - Valid certificate of incorporation\n   - List of shareholders/directors\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nKiln adheres to category 3: Approval Required. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication ](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/)page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nKiln adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nKiln commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Kiln will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nKiln has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract vulnerabilities that result in direct theft or permanent freezing of funds, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 1 000 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 100 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high Smart Contract vulnerabilities that result in direct theft or permanent freezing of unclaimed yield or commission, or the temporary freezing of unclaimed yield for more than 24hrs, the reward amount will be capped at 100% of the funds affected, up to a maximum of USD 100 000.  However, a minimum reward of USD 20 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- Any person included on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons maintained by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) or on any list pursuant to European Union (EU) and/or United Kingdom (UK) regulations.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nKiln has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://kilnfi.notion.site/EXTERNAL-AUDITS-479819dce90540d1a0800c0541d2352b](https://kilnfi.notion.site/EXTERNAL-AUDITS-479819dce90540d1a0800c0541d2352b)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\n- This bug bounty program will have a hard cap of USDC 1 500 000. In the event that multiple bug reports are submitted that exceed this amount, the rewards will be provided on a first come first served basis.\n- The following roles: Operator, Admin and Proxy Admin are trusted to behave properly and in the best interest of the users. They should not be considered as malicious.  Reports taking this assumption will be considered invalid.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Kiln team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC. \n",
