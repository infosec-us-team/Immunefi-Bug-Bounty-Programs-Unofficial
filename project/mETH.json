The program is open to all security researchers, regardless of experience or affiliation.\n\nFor more information about mETH Protocol, please visit [https://docs.mantle.xyz/meth/introduction/overview](https://docs.mantle.xyz/meth/introduction/overview)\n\nmETH Protocol provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nmETH Protocol adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nmETH Protocol commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that mETH Protocol will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\nKnown issues:\n- [https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/803](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/803)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nmETH Protocol’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://docs.mantle.xyz/meth/security/audits.](https://docs.mantle.xyz/meth/security/audits) Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, mETH Protocol has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209)",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 500 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 100 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.   \n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward increases at a multiplier of two from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.    \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the mETH Protocol team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC",
