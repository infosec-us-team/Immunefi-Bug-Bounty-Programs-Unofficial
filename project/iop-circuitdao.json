  "impactsBody": "__Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?__\n\nN/A. There shouldn’t be any confusion. \n\n\n__Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\nNo. As a CDP protocol, we have taken some inspiration from MakerDAO, both the initial single-collateral DAI system as well as some innovations of the multi-collateral version such as Dutch liquidation auctions. However, the implementation is completely different due to Chia’s coinset (UTXO) model and Chialisp as smart contract language.\n\n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs and/or what attack vectors are you most concerned about?__\n\nSee the list of in-scope bugs below. The higher the severity, the more concerned we are about the respective exploit.\n\n\n__What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported?__\n\nThe protocol makes use of Chia Asset Token (CAT) standard (https://chialisp.com/cats/), singletons (https://chialisp.com/singletons/) and various custom coin types. An overview can be found here: https://docs.circuitdao.com/technical-manual/overview#list-of-protocol-coins\n\n__What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?__\n\nMitigation measures that can be taken by governance. As an (out-of-scope) example, if Announcers collude to manipulate the Oracle price, governance can swap out the Oracle by updating the ORACLE_LAUNCHER_ID Statute within STATUTES_PRICE_DELAY. \n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nNone\n\n__What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?__\n\nNone\n\n__Which chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?__\n\nThe project will eventually be deployed on Chia (mainnet and testnet11). \n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\n\nSee the pyproject.toml files in ‘puzzles’ and ‘circuit’ Github repos.\nIn terms of security context, the Chialisp code from ‘puzzles’ repos will get deployed on Chia mainnet. We will run a Chia fullnode service to connect the dapp backend to the blockchain.\n\n__Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?__\n\nThe protocol differs from many other DeFi projects is that governance is done completely on-chain by governance token (CRT) holders. Governance proposals are created, vetoed on, and implemented (“enacted”) on-chain. There is no governance multi-sig (controlled by a foundation or otherwise).\n\nThe protocol is largely immutable, with governance being limited to changing the value of certain parameters (“Statutes”) or outputting custom conditions. The one exception to this is the Oracle singleton, which governance can replace entirely (by changing the value of the Oracle launcher ID at Statutes index 0)\n\n__What are the most valuable educational resources already available? (Ie. Documentation, Explainer videos or articles, etc)__\n\nDocumentation for Circuit protocol can be found at: https://docs.circuitdao.com/\nNote that the documentation is not up-to-date with the latest commit and contains inaccurate descriptions in several places. However, the docs should work well as an introduction to and general overview of the protocol.\n\nSRs may also be interested in the audit report by Zellic: \n\nChialisp-related documentation can be found at: https://chialisp.com/\n\nThe protocol makes use of modern chialisp features: https://chialisp.com/modern-chialisp/",

  "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
