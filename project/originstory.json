The Story platform dramatically lowers the barriers of entry for creators to mint their first NFT and continually create more value for their collectors.

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the  [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 25 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nThe following issues are considered out of scope of the program:\n  - Issues related to Season bootstraps not occurring when no stakes have been made during a Season\n  - Issues requiring the deployer (the Origin Protocol team) to deploy a misconfigured Season.\n\nIn addition, any known issues highlighted in the following audit report are considered out of scope:\n  - [https://github.com/OriginProtocol/security/blob/master/audits/Solidified%20-%20OGN%20Staking%20-%20July%202022.pdf](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/security/blob/master/audits/Solidified%20-%20OGN%20Staking%20-%20July%202022.pdf) \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Origin Protocol__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are made in the stablecoin __OUSD__.",
