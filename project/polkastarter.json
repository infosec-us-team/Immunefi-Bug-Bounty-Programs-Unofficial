  "programOverview": "Polkastarter is a protocol built for cross-chain token pools and auctions, enabling projects to raise capital in a decentralized, permissionless and interoperable environment based on Polkadot.\n\nThe platform allows cryptocurrency projects to raise funds by setting up a swap pool based on a fixed purchase rate for tokens. These so-called “Fixed Swap Pools” have many advantages for token sale investors over traditional fundraising models like ICOs, IEOs and IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings). Fixed Swap Pools will maintain the token price throughout the sale until the initial supply is bought.\n\nWith Polkastarter, decentralized projects will be able to raise and exchange capital cheap and fast. Users will be able to participate in a secure and compliant environment and to use assets that go way beyond the current ERC20 standard.\n\nFor more information about Polkastarter, please visit [https://polkastarter.com/ ](https://polkastarter.com/) \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\nAny unintentional withdrawing/draining of funds from the staking contract on ETH and BSC (i.e. theft of the POLS staked)",

However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Polkastarter__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
