      "programOverview": "Polkastarter is a protocol built for cross-chain token pools and auctions, enabling projects to raise capital in a decentralized, permissionless and interoperable environment based on Polkadot.\n\nThe platform allows cryptocurrency projects to raise funds by setting up a swap pool based on a fixed purchase rate for tokens. These so-called “Fixed Swap Pools” have many advantages for token sale investors over traditional fundraising models like ICOs, IEOs and IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings). Fixed Swap Pools will maintain the token price throughout the sale until the initial supply is bought.\n\nWith Polkastarter, decentralized projects will be able to raise and exchange capital cheap and fast. Users will be able to participate in a secure and compliant environment and to use assets that go way beyond the current ERC20 standard.\n\nFor more information about Polkastarter, please visit [https://polkastarter.com/ ](https://polkastarter.com/) \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\nAny unintentional withdrawing/draining of funds from the staking contract on ETH and BSC (i.e. theft of the POLS staked)\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll critical bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Polkastarter__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in __USDC__ or __USDT__, up to the discretion of the team.",
