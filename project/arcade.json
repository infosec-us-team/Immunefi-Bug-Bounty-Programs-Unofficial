      "programOverview": "Arcade.xyz is the first of its kind Web3 platform to enable liquid lending markets for NFTs. At Arcade.xyz, we think all assets will eventually become digitized and that NFTs represent a 0 to 1 innovation in storing value and ownership attribution for unique digital assets.\n\nArcade.xyz's focus is on building primitives, infrastructure, and applications enabling the growth of NFTs as an asset class. As such, the first product we released is an innovative peer to peer lending marketplace that allows NFT owners to unlock liquidity on baskets of NFTs on Ethereum. Lenders that hold stablecoins or ERC20 tokens can participate in a new source of DeFi yield by underwriting term loans collateralized by borrowers' NFTs.\n\nArcade.xyz is our end user application that strives to become the premier liquidity venue for NFTs, via a protocol for NFT collateralized loans with flexible terms. Today NFTs are largely digital representations of artwork and media content, however, our belief is that in the not so distant future NFTs will encompass digital rights, metaverse assets, and digital identity.\n\nFor more information about Arcade.xyz, please visit [https://docs.arcadedao.xyz](https://docs.arcadedao.xyz).\n\nOn October 24, 2023, ArcadeDAO was launched, featuring a [governance system](https://docs.arcadedao.xyz/docs/governance-source-code) that empowers members to actively influence both the technical and non-technical facets of the DAO and the Arcade Protocol. The $ARCD token functions as the governance token for ArcadeDAO.\n\nTo increase the utility of the $ARCD token and enhance user engagement in the Arcade ecosystem, ArcadeDAO introduced two staking strategies. These strategies offer users the chance to earn rewards while participating in DAO governance and providing liquidity.\n\nTo learn more, please visit [https://docs.arcadedao.xyz/docs/arcade-staking-documentation](https://docs.arcadedao.xyz/docs/arcade-staking-documentation).\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nArcade adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- \nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nArcade commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Arcade will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n- [https://github.com/arcadexyz/arcade-protocol/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/arcadexyz/arcade-protocol/tree/main/audits)\n- [https://github.com/arcadexyz/dao-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#known-gotchas](https://github.com/arcadexyz/dao-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#known-gotchas)\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Arcade has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team.

For instance, a borrower using a fake BAYC contract as collateral to trick a lender into giving favorable terms is an attack that is out of scope for this program.\n\nAny attack related to convincing lenders to lend against assets flagged as stolen on other platforms (e.g. OpenSea) is out of scope.\n\nAny phishing attack that requires social engineering in order to convince one counterparty to enter a loan under false pretenses (e.g. forcing them to sign loan terms differing from ones on a phishing UI), is considered out of scope for this program.\n\n  - Any attack that has been previously reported, whether or not it has been publicly disclosed\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Non-protocol related attacks around signatures (e.g. phishing sites that entice users to sign signatures with unfavorable terms)",
