      "programOverview": "Boba Network is a blockchain Layer-2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees up to 100x less than Layer-1.\n\nBoba Network’s Hybrid Compute technology brings the power of Web2 on-chain for the first time, allowing smart contracts to call any external Web2 API to execute complex algorithms such as machine learning classifiers, pull in real-world or enterprise data in a single atomic transaction, or sync with the latest state of a gaming engine. Leveraging off-chain compute and real-world data, developers and creators can offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.\n\nBoba Network is delivering a faster, cheaper, and smarter experience for blockchain’s next billion users.\n\nFor more information about Boba Network, please visit [https://boba.network/](https://boba.network/).  \n\nFor testing any exploits involving cross-domain transactions, it is recommended to work with Boba’s local devnet stack (https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml#L1332)  (for Boba-Eth) or Boba’s dockerized services (https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba_legacy/blob/de21c96e0632c2e54927acbb54479c85508bec07/.circleci/config.yml#L14-L19) and modifying integration tests (https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba_legacy/blob/25450b4024b0ac6c1789cc55b6dc15675200ed9b/integration-tests/test/bridged-tokens.spec.ts) (for Boba-BNB).\n\nNote: Boba-Eth has been migrated to anchorage (v3) and differs in design and architecture from Boba-BNB (v2). Find more about anchorage specs here: https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba?tab=readme-ov-file#specification.",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All High and Critical Blockchain/DLT/Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n- Contracts are upgradable. \n- The fact that fraud proofs are not yet running. \n- A bug in Lib_MerkleTrie.sol which will prevent withdrawals from succeeding in some cases. There is a workaround for this, by modifying the proof to add an extra element. \n- A bug in Lib_ResolvedDelegateProxy.sol which could result in a storage slot key collision overwriting the address of the implementation. This bug is dependent on the layout of the implementation contract, and Boba is not affected. \n- The user cannot commit to a L1 gas price, the OVM_GasPriceOracle is owned by a key controlled by Boba and is responsible for setting the L1 gas price.\n- There appears to be an obvious bug which would allow an attacker to withdraw a fake ERC20 token from L2 in exchange for a real ERC20 (such as WBTC) token on L1. There is no check in the L2StandardBridge, however the withdrawal is prevented from finalizing by a check in the L1StandardBridge. Naturally if you do find a way to circumvent Boba Network’s protections, then you would be rewarded.\n- All vulnerabilities mentioned in https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba_legacy/tree/develop/boba_audits \n\nBoba Network requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward for critical and high threat levels.
