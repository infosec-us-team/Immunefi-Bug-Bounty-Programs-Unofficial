  "programOverview": "Boba Network is a blockchain Layer-2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees up to 100x less than Layer-1.\n\nBoba Network’s Hybrid Compute technology brings the power of Web2 on-chain for the first time, allowing smart contracts to call any external Web2 API to execute complex algorithms such as machine learning classifiers, pull in real-world or enterprise data in a single atomic transaction, or sync with the latest state of a gaming engine. Leveraging off-chain compute and real-world data, developers and creators can offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.\n\nBoba Network is delivering a faster, cheaper, and smarter experience for blockchain’s next billion users.\n\nFor more information about Boba Network, please visit [https://boba.network/](https://boba.network/).  \n\nFor testing any exploits involving cross-domain transactions, it is recommended to work with Boba’s local devnet stack [https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml#L1332](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml#L1332)  (for Boba-Eth) \nNote: Boba now operates on the Anchorage stack, a derivative of the op-stack.  Find more about the op-stack specs here: [https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba?tab=readme-ov-file#specification](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba?tab=readme-ov-file#specification)\n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nBoba Network will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Boba Network has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",

All High and Critical Blockchain/DLT/Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical blockchain vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__. \n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100 000. However, a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor web/app bugs, reports will be rewarded within a range of __USD 1 000 - 3 000__ depending on severity levels and will be rewarded according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n- Contracts are upgradable. \n- The fact that fraud proofs are not yet running. \n- A bug in Lib_MerkleTrie.sol which will prevent withdrawals from succeeding in some cases. There is a workaround for this, by modifying the proof to add an extra element. \n- A bug in Lib_ResolvedDelegateProxy.sol which could result in a storage slot key collision overwriting the address of the implementation. This bug is dependent on the layout of the implementation contract, and Boba is not affected. \n- The user cannot commit to a L1 gas price, the OVM_GasPriceOracle is owned by a key controlled by Boba and is responsible for setting the L1 gas price.\n- There appears to be an obvious bug which would allow an attacker to withdraw a fake ERC20 token from L2 in exchange for a real ERC20 (such as WBTC) token on L1. There is no check in the L2StandardBridge, however the withdrawal is prevented from finalizing by a check in the L1StandardBridge. Naturally if you do find a way to circumvent Boba Network’s protections, then you would be rewarded.\n- All vulnerabilities mentioned in https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba_legacy/tree/develop/boba_audits \n\nBoba Network requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward for critical and high threat levels. The information needed is proof of your identity. The collection of this information will be done by the Boba Foundation.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Boba Foundation__ and are denominated in USD.
