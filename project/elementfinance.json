      "programOverview": "Element Finance brings high fixed yield income to the DeFi market, initially focused on ETH, BTC, USDC, and DAI. Users can purchase ETH, BTC, USDC, and DAI at a discount without being locked into a term, allowing the exchange of the discounted asset and the base asset at any time. The fixed rate income can be secured with the exchange of any major base asset. For active DeFi users, the Element Protocol provides capital efficiency on yield positions they are already depositing into, such as Yearn or ETH2 staking. Users can sell their deposited principal at a discount as fixed yield income, leveraging or increasing exposure to yield without liquidation risk. This competitive activity is what drives the high fixed yield markets. This construction paper breaks down the Element Protocol and discusses how it can open the door to a number of new primitives and innovations.\n\nFurther information regarding Element Finance can be found on their Construction Paper, [https://paper.element.fi/](https://paper.element.fi/).  \nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the loss of user funds and the access to those funds without user permission.\n",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nIn addition to assessing severity, the rewards will be considered based on the impact of the discovered vulnerability as well as the level of difficulty in discovering such vulnerability.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Element Finance__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payouts are done in __DAI__ or __USDC__.\n",

However, the Smart Contracts listed in this table are prioritized, and this prioritization is taken into account when deciding on the reward amount.\n\n__Disclosure and Reporting Guidelines__\n\nWe ask that all bug bounty hunters, security engineers, and researchers:\n\n  - Make it a priority to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user   experience, and disruption to production systems during security testing.\n  - Report vulnerabilities as soon as they have been discovered and keep them confidential between yourself and the Element team until the issue(s) has been resolved.\n  - Only use the Immunefi bug reporting interface to report vulnerability information to us.\n  - Provide the team with at least 5 working days to investigate the issue and get back to you before taking any further action.\n",
