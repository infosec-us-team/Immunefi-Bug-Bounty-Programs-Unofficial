Lista DAO's native CDP stablecoin is known as lisUSD, and it is over-collateralized against a variety of tokens such as BNB, ETH, wBETH and slisBNB. Upon borrowing lisUSD, users can opt to stake their holdings for long-term yield on affiliated partner DEXes, engage in trading activities, or utilize lisUSD as a form of monetary payment.\n\nLista DAO also offers simple and secure liquid staking solutions on the BNB Smart Chain, with users minting Lista Staked BNB, slisBNB, in exchange for staking their BNB. The staked BNB is held securely on BSC validator nodes providing attractive liquid staking yields on their staked BNB.",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\n__Reward calculation of Critical bug reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 1 000 000 USD__, however there is a minimum of __USD 100 000__\n\n__Reward calculation of High bug reports__\t\n\nHigh severity vulnerabilities concerning theft of unclaimed yield, permanent freezing of unclaimed yield, and temporary freezing of funds for a minimum period of 30 days are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed. \n\nAll vulnerabilities marked in the [Certik security review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A_iAbKkRyToXjFA25v8gLFfuSqFuIPEd/view?usp=sharing), [Peckshield security review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tyH5DAg0EE12TKOvucORw-kSsXpJFofu/view?usp=sharing), [Slowmist security review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ki1MrZcnkHReKuR5cMY40n2j-U9bnx25/view?usp=sharing), [Veridise security review](https://github.com/lista-dao/lista-dao-contracts/blob/master/audits/Veridise_270622.pdf) and https://github.com/lista-dao/synclub-contracts/tree/master/audit and https://github.com/lista-dao/lista-dao-contracts/tree/master/audits are not eligible for a reward.\n\nAll rewards for the Lista bug bounty program are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 1,000__ for each severity level, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Lista__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__.
