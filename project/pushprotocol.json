      "programOverview": "Push Protocol is the communication protocol of web3. Push enables cross-chain notifications (on chain / off chain), messaging, video for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet / frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nFor more information about Push Protocol, please visit [https://push.org/.](https://push.org/) \n\nPush Protocol provides rewards in PUSH. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n\n- Push Protocol requires a signup on [https://epns.synaps.me/signup](https://epns.synaps.me/signup)\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nPush Protocol adheres to category 2. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nPush Protocol adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n\n- Smart Contracts, Critical Severity Level\n- Smart Contracts, High Severity Level\n- Smart Contracts, Medium Severity Level\n- Smart Contracts, Low Severity Level\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nPush Protocol commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Push Protocol will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nPush Protocol has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n\n__Invoicing Information__\n\nIf needed by the security researcher, Push Protocol is able to provide the necessary information for the proper issuance of an invoice. This includes:\n- Legal Entity Name\n- Registered Address",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor Critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 80,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\nFor High Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 100% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 50,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- Any country or government or international authority, including the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the US Department of State, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty's Treasury, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority or the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nPush Protocol has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [Push Protocol V1 Audit Report](https://github.com/ChainSafe/audits/blob/main/EPNS/epns-protocol-10-2021.pdf)\n- [Push Protocol V1.5 Audit Report](https://github.com/ChainSafe/audits/blob/main/EPNS/epns-protocol-11-2022.pdf)\n- [Push Protocol V2 Audit Report](https://github.com/ChainSafe/audits/blob/main/EPNS/epns-protocol-05-2023.pdf)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n\n- Smart Contract, Critical Severity Level\n- Smart Contract, High Severity Level\n- Smart Contract, Medium Severity Level\n- Smart Contract, Low Severity Level\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Push Protocol team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in PUSH.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.",
