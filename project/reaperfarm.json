      "programOverview": "Reaper is an auto-compounding yield farm which maximizes user's yields by leveraging the power of compound interest.\n\nSimply deposit your liquidity tokens with them and they will farm for you. Whenever a reward is emitted they swap it for more liquidity tokens and put them back to work.\n\nFor more information about Reaper Farm, please visit [https://docs.reaper.farm/reaper-farms/](https://docs.reaper.farm/reaper-farms/)\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of more than 10%",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n Smart Contracts and Blockchain \n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Solidity/EVM details not considered\n    - including integer over-/under-flow\n    - including rounding errors\n    - including unhandled exceptions\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n    - including composability vulnerabilities\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n  - Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n  - Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll Critical/High/Medium smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of USD 75 000 for Critical bug reports. \n\nTheft of Yield is considered Critical if the theft is greater than the equivalent of __USD 100 000__.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Reaper Farm__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __OATH__, __USDC__ or a mix of both, at the discretion of the team.",
