  "programOverview": "RootstockLabs, previously IOVLabs, have been longstanding contributors to Rootstock, Bitcoin’s DeFi layer. Launched in 2018, Rootstock allows anyone to develop apps and services on top of the planet’s most secure and decentralized financial infrastructure; Bitcoin. \nToday we continue to contribute to Rootstock’s evolution by building tools and technology focused on scaling Bitcoin and making it work for everyone. \n\nRootstockLabs is making Bitcoin work for everyone. We believe Bitcoin will play a crucial role in breaking down barriers to economic participation, providing the world’s most secure and decentralized financial infrastructure to empower people everywhere to exercise their economic rights more fully.\n\nSeamless payments without punitive charges for small businesses; savings that protect people from inflation; remittances that allow the ninety-nine percent to move capital as easily as the one; and loans that fuel grassroots economic growth—all denominated in stablecoins and available through the intuitive smartphone interfaces of today’s Web2—this is what we call Everyday DeFi.\n\nFor more information about RootstockLabs, please visit [https://www.rootstocklabs.com/](https://www.rootstocklabs.com/), [https://rootstock.io/](https://rootstock.io/) and/or [https://rif.technology](https://rif.technology/)\n\nRootstockLabs provides rewards in USDC on ETH, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nRootstockLabs adheres to **Category 2: Notice Required**. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nRootstockLabs adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Blockchain/DLT  —  Critical\n- Blockchain/DLT  —  High\n- Smart Contract  —  Critical\n- Smart Contract  —  High\n- Website & Application  —  Critical\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nRootstockLabs’s completed audit reports can be found at [http://rootstock.io/blog/rsk-security-audit-results/](http://rootstock.io/blog/rsk-security-audit-results/) and [https://rootstock.io/blog/rsk-powhsm-is-now-open-source/.](https://rootstock.io/blog/rsk-powhsm-is-now-open-source/)\nAny unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs on HSM Firmware , the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward **USD 200 000**. However, a minimum reward of **USD 20 000** is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT on HSM Firmware bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)\nUSD 20 000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork)\nUSD 20 000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)\nUSD 20 000\n- Permanent remote disruption of the HSM device or middleware\nUSD 20 000\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs on powpeg-node and rskj , the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward USD 50 000. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)\nUSD $10 000 \n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork)\nUSD $10 000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)\nUSD $10 000\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\nFor critical web/apps bugs, reports will be rewarded with USD 10 000, only if the impact leads to:\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of USD 5 000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. \n- The amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at **100%** and then a reduction of **25%** from the amount of the first attack for every **[150 blocks]** the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high Blockchain/DLT non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Unintended chain split (network partition)\nUSD 5 000 for powpeg-node and rskj  and USD 10 000 for HSM Firmware\n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments\nUSD 5 000 for powpeg-node and rskj  and USD 10 000 for HSM Firmware\n- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters\nUSD 5 000 for powpeg-node and rskj  and USD 10 000 for HSM Firmware\n- RPC API crash affecting projects with greater than or equal to 25% of the market capitalization on top of the respective layer\nUSD 5 000 for powpeg-node and rskj  and USD 10 000 for HSM Firmware\n- Temporary remote disruption of the HSM device or middleware\n USD 10 000 for HSM Firmware\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 5 000 to USD 10 000 with the reward calculated based on **100%** of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward. \nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Medium Level Reports__\n\nFor all Medium level bugs found on HSM Firmware, the reward will be USD 5 000. For Medium level bugs found on powpeg-node and rskj, the reward will be USD 2 500.\n\n__Reward Calculation for Low Level Reports__\n\nFor all Low level bugs found on HSM Firmware, the reward will be USD 2 500. For Medium level bugs found on powpeg-node and rskj, the reward will be USD 1 000.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the RootstockLabs team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on ETH.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",

The only realistic remote reachability is indirect, via untrusted but consensus-valid on-chain data produced and propagated by the RSK network, synchronized by Powpeg-Node, and forwarded to the middleware (and subsequently to the HSM) for processing, where it may trigger vulnerable parsing/validation/logic.\n\n__Local__\n\n“Local” means the attacker has obtained root (or equivalent) control of the host running Powpeg-Node, the middleware, and the HSM (for example via shell/SSH access, a compromised account, or malware), but does not require physical access to the machine or device. With this level of access, the attacker can directly issue commands to the HSM via its local interfaces, ultimately affecting HSM operations.\n\n__Physical__\n\n“Physical” means the attacker has obtained physical access to the HSM device, enabling direct interaction and potential hardware tampering. With this level of access, the attacker may be able to probe, manipulate, reset, fault, or modify the device or its connections, potentially bypassing logical protections and ultimately affecting HSM operations.",
