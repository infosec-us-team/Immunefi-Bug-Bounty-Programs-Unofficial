      "programOverview": "Perpetual protocol, formerly known as Strike, was created in 2019 inspired by emerging DeFi protocols such as Synthetix and Uniswap. The team sought to combine the merits of these protocols to create a decentralized perpetual contract trading protocol on Ethereum. The protocol is capable of supporting 10x leverage, short positions, and lower slippage compared to other AMMs thanks to its virtual AMM (vAMM) design.\n\nUnlike well known Automated Market Makers used for both token swaps and price discovery, the vAMM is solely used for price discovery to handle leverage and short positions. Similar to Uniswap, traders can trade with the vAMM without central authorities and is designed to be market neutral and fully collateralized.\n\nPERP is the protocol’s ERC-20 native token. PERP tokens allow community members to govern the protocol and stake their tokens for a fixed amount of time to the Staking Pool. In return, holders are rewarded with the staking incentive, which includes rewards in PERP and transaction fees.\n\nFurther resources regarding Perpetual can be found on their website, [https://v2docs.perp.fi/](https://v2docs.perp.fi/). ",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll Critical/High/Medium severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical severity rewards for the Perpetual bug bounty program are scaled based on internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in place. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__, and rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Perpetual__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __PERP__ on Optimism. All amounts are calculated using a 7-day TWAP price, based on the past 7 days up till the day the bug report is submitted. \n\nAll smart contracts of Perpetual can be found at [https://github.com/perpetual-protocol](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol). However, only those in the Assets in Scope table are considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nIf an impact can be caused to any other asset managed by Perpetual that isn’t on this table but for which the impact is in the Impacts in Scope section below, you are encouraged to submit it for the consideration by the project. \n",
