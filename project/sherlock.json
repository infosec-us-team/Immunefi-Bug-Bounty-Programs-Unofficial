Anything else that results in a material loss/freezing of user funds that is unprofitable for the hacker is classified as High. \n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nKnown issues in their previous audits are considered out-of-scope: https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-v2-core/tree/main/audits\n\nIssues identified in previous audit reports may not be eligible for payout\n\nTo be eligible for reward, impact from table below must be demonstrated where all thefts must be profitable and all freezing must be reasonably priced for the impact.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Sherlock__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
