      "programOverview": "Lido on Polkadot is a liquid staking solution for DOT.\nLido lets users earn DOT staking rewards without needing to maintain infrastructure and enables them to trade staked positions, as well as participate in on-chain decentralized finance with their staked assets.\nLido on Polkadot gives you:\n  - Liquidity through tokenization — no activation delays and the ability to sell your staked tokens or use them in decentralized finance;\n  - One-click staking — no complicated steps;\n  - Decentralized security and maximized staking performance — assets spread across the best performing validators from the whole network, that are not predefined. That is possible because of an algorithm based on provable data and decentralized oracles. You can learn more [here](https://mixbytes.io/blog/lido-on-polkadot-uncapped-second-stage).\n\nFor more information about Lido on Polkadot, please visit [https://lido.fi/polkadot](https://lido.fi/polkadot).",
