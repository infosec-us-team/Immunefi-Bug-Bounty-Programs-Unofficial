Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Index Coop__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.",
