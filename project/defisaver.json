All High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\nAll vulnerabilities marked in the [security reviews](https://github.com/DecenterApps/defisaver-v3-contracts/tree/main/audits) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Defi Saver__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
