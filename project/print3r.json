When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nPRINT3R adheres to the Primacy of Rules for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Medium - Block stuffing\n- Smart Contract - Medium - Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)\n- Smart Contract - Medium - Theft of gas\n- Smart Contract - Medium - Unbounded gas consumption\n- Website & Applications - Medium - Redirecting users to malicious websites (Open Redirect)\n- Website & Applications - Medium - Third-Party API keys leakage that demonstrates loss of funds or modification on the website.\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nPRINT3R commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that PRINT3R will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nPRINT3R has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- If the BRRR pool has a high utilization not all BRRR tokens will be immediately redeemable, the borrowing fee should increase in this case and is considered regular operation\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nAt Immunefi, we sometimes receive reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Therefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards)which by default states what a Projects should or should not cite when downgrading a bug report’s impact, severity, and/or payout amount.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract + Critical - PoC Required\n- Smart Contract + High - PoC Required\n- Websites & Applications - Critical - PoC Required\n- Websites & Applications - High - PoC Required\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide[ PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the PRINT3R team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC. ",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "These impacts are out of scope for this bug bounty program. \n\n__All Categories__\n\n- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist) except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code\n- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Feature requests\n- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity impacts\n- Impacts from Sybil attacks\n- Impacts involving centralization risks\n- Best practice recommendations\n- If the BRRR pool has a high utilization not all BRRR tokens will be immediately redeemable, the borrowing fee should increase in this case and is considered regular operation\n\n__Web/App__ \n\n- Theoretical impacts without any proof or demonstration\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring physical access to the victim device\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring access to the local network of the victim\n- Reflected plain text injection (e.g. url parameters, path, etc.)\n   - This does not exclude reflected HTML injection with or without JavaScript\n   - This does not exclude persistent plain text injection\n- Any impacts involving self-XSS\n- Captcha bypass using OCR without impact demonstration\n- CSRF with no state modifying security impact (e.g. logout CSRF)\n- Impacts related to missing HTTP Security Headers (such as X-FRAME-OPTIONS) or cookie security flags (such as “httponly”) without demonstration of impact\n- Server-side non-confidential information disclosure, such as IPs, server names, and most stack traces\n- Impacts causing only the enumeration or confirmation of the existence of users or tenants\n- Impacts caused by vulnerabilities requiring un-prompted, in-app user actions that are not part of the normal app workflows\n- Lack of SSL/TLS best practices\n- Impacts that only require DDoS\n- UX and UI impacts that do not materially disrupt use of the platform\n- Impacts primarily caused by browser/plugin defects\n- Leakage of non sensitive API keys (e.g. Etherscan, Infura, Alchemy, etc.)\n- Any vulnerability exploit requiring browser bugs for exploitation (e.g. CSP bypass) \n- SPF/DMARC misconfigured records\n- Missing HTTP Headers without demonstrated impact\n- Automated scanner reports without demonstrated impact\n- UI/UX best practice recommendations\n- Non-future-proof NFT rendering\n",
