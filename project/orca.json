In traditional AMM liquidity pools, a user provides liquidity across the entire continuous price curve. With Whirlpools, each user can specify the price range where they will provide liquidity.\n\nFor more information on Orca, please visit [https://orca.so/](https://orca.so/) or [Orca’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/orca_so).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nAll known issues previously highlighted in the following audits are considered as out of scope: \n  - [Neodyme Audit](https://orca-so.gitbook.io/orca-developer-portal/whirlpools/overview#security-audits)\n  - [Kudelski Security](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u0ja4_3GoogVWVU9prMezDrBaqE5BxdW/view)\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities can be further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Orca__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts of up to __USD 250 000__ are done in __ORCA__ or __USDC__ (SPL Version) at the discretion of the team. Payouts above __USD 250 000__ will be done in __ORCA__ and will be vested monthly over a 12-month period.",
