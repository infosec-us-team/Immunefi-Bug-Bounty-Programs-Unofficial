      "programOverview": "Stargate is a community-driven organization building the first fully composable native asset bridge, and the first dApp built on LayerZero.\n\nStargate's vision is to make cross-chain liquidity transfer a seamless, single transaction process.\n\nFor more information about Stargate, please visit [https://stargate.finance/](https://stargate.finance/) and [https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate).\n\nStargate provides rewards in __USDC__ on __Ethereum__, denominated in __USD__. For more details about the payment process, please view the __Rewards by Threat Level__ section.\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nStargate will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n- Eligibility Criteria \n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nStargate adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nStargate’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/v2-developer-docs/security/audit](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/v2-developer-docs/security/audit). Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Stargate has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 10 000 000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 10 000 to USD 100 000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional [24h] that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Stargate Foundation team directly, on behalf of the StargateDAO, and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __USDC__ on __Ethereum__.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
