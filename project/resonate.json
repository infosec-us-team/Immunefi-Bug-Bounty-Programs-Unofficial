Those who hold tokens which may be deposited into yield-bearing systems can receive an instant, upfront payment on the present value of that future yield, in exchange for locking their tokens. An ideal solution for traders who want to receive guaranteed and consistent yield farming rewards for staking tokens or providing liquidity. \n\nFor those who want to purchase the Yield Futures, or the rights to future yield, Resonate places them in a position where they can do so at a discount to the expected future value of the interest. For protocols wanting to reduce their burn rate, this discount can offer a better way to incentivize providing LPs.\n\nFor more information about Resonate, please visit [https://www.resonate.finance/](https://www.resonate.finance/).",

However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 40 000__. \n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 30 000__ only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds.
