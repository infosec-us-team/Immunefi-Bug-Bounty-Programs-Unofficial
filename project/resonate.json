Those who hold tokens which may be deposited into yield-bearing systems can receive an instant, upfront payment on the present value of that future yield, in exchange for locking their tokens. An ideal solution for traders who want to receive guaranteed and consistent yield farming rewards for staking tokens or providing liquidity. \n\nFor those who want to purchase the Yield Futures, or the rights to future yield, Resonate places them in a position where they can do so at a discount to the expected future value of the interest. For protocols wanting to reduce their burn rate, this discount can offer a better way to incentivize providing LPs.\n\nFor more information about Resonate, please visit [https://www.resonate.finance/](https://www.resonate.finance/).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll Critical/High/Medium severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 40 000__. \n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 30 000__ only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than __USD 15 000__.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit report are considered out of scope: \n  - [Zellic Audit Part 1](https://www.resonate.finance/audits/Zellic-Part-I.pdf)\n  - [Zellic Audit Part 2](https://www.resonate.finance/audits/Zellic-Part-II.pdf)\n  - [BlockSec Audit](https://www.resonate.finance/audits/BlockSec-Audit.pdf)\n  - [BlockSec Oracle Audit](https://www.resonate.finance/audits/BlockSec-Oracle-Audit.pdf)\n  - [Bug Bounty Report by GalloDaSballo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NJm2d7JK5a8Cu-TGNip8AQwiVtNqcdd818xyUHkRnCM/edit)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Resonate__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
