      "programOverview": "C3 is a next generation self-custodial exchange transforming the market structure of crypto and providing a secure, transparent, and trustless platform for trading. C3 offers all of the functionality of traditional exchanges, including instant execution, high throughput, REST APIs, Websocket connectivity, advanced order types and support for all networks, without any of the trade-offs. With C3, users can enjoy the benefits of decentralization including trustless and self-custody without sacrificing the performance and accessibility that they expect from traditional exchanges and robust trading platforms.\n\nFor more information about C3, please visit [https://blog.c3.io](https://blog.c3.io). Given C3’s unique architecture that leverages off-chain components, we encourage security researches to learn more about it in the following posts: [https://blog.c3.io/technical-overview-of-c3-everything-you-need-to-know/](https://blog.c3.io/technical-overview-of-c3-everything-you-need-to-know/) and [https://blog.c3.io/c3s-multi-layered-security-architecture/](https://blog.c3.io/c3s-multi-layered-security-architecture/). \n\nC3 provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\nWhilst this program does not request for KYC, C3 reserves the right to ensure security researchers are not subject OFAC sanctions and cannot be on the SDN list.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nC3 adheres to category 3 Approval Needed. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication ](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/)page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nC3 adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract: Critical\n- Smart Contract: High\n- Smart Contract: Medium\n- Smart Contract: Low\n- Web/App: Critical\n- Web/App: High\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact).\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. \n\n*If the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nC3 commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that C3 will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nC3 has provided these completed audit reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://github.com/c3exchange/c3-smartcontracts-v1/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/c3exchange/c3-smartcontracts-v1/tree/main/audits)\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nWe may receive reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real), but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in reality. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, mitigation measures that can prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards)which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, C3 has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded/paused/killed, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading, pausing, or in some cases, killing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that can not be upgraded/paused/killed, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.   \n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward increases at a multiplier of two from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.  \n\nFor critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with USD 100 000, only if the impact leads to:\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Unauthorized withdrawals of tokens on-chain\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the C3 team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
