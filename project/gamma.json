This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nThe following known issues would be considered as out-of-scope of this bounty program: \n  - For the UniProxy contract, its deposit configuration is its operational context. Attacks which depend on different configuration than provided for their example hypervisor contract are not to be considered\n  - For the xGamma contract, an attack is possible wherein the attacker deposits just before and withdraws just after rebase. In our operational context, they do not send funds (rebase) to the xGamma contract outside of private rpc.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Gamma__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in either __GAMMA__, __ETH__ or __USDC__, up to the discretion of the team.",
