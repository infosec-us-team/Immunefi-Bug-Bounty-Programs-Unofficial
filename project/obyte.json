      "programOverview": "Obyte is a distributed ledger based on directed acyclic graph **(DAG)** and is without middlemen. Unlike centralized ledgers and blockchains, access to the Obyte ledger is decentralized, disintermediated, free (as in freedom), equal, and open.\n\nThe Obyte Foundation is interested in securing their network, their core library, their GUI wallet, and some of their autonomous agents (smart contracts that operate completely independently). Primary areas of concern are around loss of user funds, DoS(not DDoS), and total network shutdown.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nObyte adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to the [Responsible Publication ](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/)page.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nObyte adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nGiven that the reward for High is flat, there is no distinction between a one-time attack and an attack that is repeated and the reward stays the same. \n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward:\n\n- Compensated team members of the Obyte Foundation\n- Employees and team members of third-party suppliers to an Obyte Foundation affiliate that operate in a technical capacity and have assets covered in this bug bounty program\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor Blockchain/DLT bug reports, in order to qualify for the reward of USD 50 000, the bug reported must be able to cause unrecoverable total network shutdown of the entire Obyte network or allow the unpermitted execution of transactions from accounts of other users without their private keys. All other critical bug reports are capped at a flat rate of USD 2 500.\n\n__Other Restrictions__\n\nFor all impacts directly involving funds being lost, the minimum impact is USD 1 000. Anything below is considered out-of-scope. \n\nThe web/app  impacts of “Stealing User Cookies” and “Bypassing Authentication” are only accepted if they result in a loss of at least USD 1 000. The web/app impact of “Ability to execute system commands” is only accepted if the actions are done as root.\n\n\n__Poc Requirements__\nAll web and app bug reports must come with a PoC. All bug reports submitted without PoC will be rejected with instructions to provide PoC.\n\nPayouts are handled by the Obyte Foundation directly and are denominated in USD. The payout can be completed in GBYTE, BTC, or USDT.",
