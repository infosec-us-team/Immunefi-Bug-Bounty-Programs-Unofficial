      "programOverview": "NFTfi is the leading liquidity protocol for NFTs. NFTfi allows NFT owners to use the assets (NFTs) they own to access the liquidity they need by receiving secured loans from liquidity providers, peer-to-peer, in a completely trustless manner.\n\nFor more information about NFTfi, please visit [https://www.nftfi.com/ ](https://www.nftfi.com/) \n\nNFTfi provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nNFTfi adheres to category 3: Approval Required. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nNFTfi adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nNFTfi commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that NFTfi will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nNFTfi has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs on testnet assets, the reward is paid as a flat amount of USD 20 000. This is because there are no actual funds at risk on the testnet, hence limits objective calculation. \n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n\n- It is possible to create an offer with an editable bundle to steal customer's funds.\n\nThe `PermittedNFTsAndTypeRegistry` ([https://etherscan.io/address/0xadde73498902f61bfcb702e94c31c13c534879ac](https://etherscan.io/address/0xadde73498902f61bfcb702e94c31c13c534879ac)) defines which NFTs are permitted.\n\nThe following address is allowed: **0xf8CB0341563213BF33EaFFc7a6775Ed0Eb6c1401** (`NftfiBundler.sol`)\n\naddress bundle = hub.getContract(ContractKeys.NFTFI_BUNDLER);\nrequire(_loanTerms.nftCollateralContract != bundle, \"Collateral cannot be bundle\");\n\n[https://github.com/NFTfi-Genesis/nftfi.eth/blob/ae6625a0e9dbf4841bda279d0848d4b0512d6fb2/V2/contracts/loans/direct/loanTypes/DirectLoanFixedOffer.sol#L169C17-L169C17](https://github.com/NFTfi-Genesis/nftfi.eth/blob/ae6625a0e9dbf4841bda279d0848d4b0512d6fb2/V2/contracts/loans/direct/loanTypes/DirectLoanFixedOffer.sol#L169C17-L169C17)\n\nIn a practical scenario, the NFTfi frontend will not display offers from the `NftfiBundler.sol` collection but the deployed smart contracts do allow them to be created and accepted.\n\n- Create offers with a wrapped collateral (that can be unwrapped) to steal user funds\nThe `wrapCollateral(...)` function inside the new `DirectLoanFixedOffer.sol` will:\n\n1- Create an NFT that is wrapper for the asset in custody (which can be unwrapped and left empty)\n\n2- Approve the wrapper in the `PermittedNFTsAndTypeRegistry`.\n\n3- Update the loan and set this wrapper as the asset in escrow instead of the NFT.\n\nAfter this loan finishes, the wrapper can be used in other loans - attacker front-runs user calls to `acceptOffer(...)` to empty the wrapper and sends them an empty wrapper.\n\nIn practice the NFTfi front-end will not display offers from this collection (the wrapper) but the deployed smart contracts do allow them to be created and accepted.\n\n- It is possible to have some NFTs change ownership (and state) while in escrow such that the loan cannot be resolved (repaid or liquidated) - for example ENS domain names expiring and being re-registered by a new owner while the loan is in progress.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nNFTfi has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gKMFWlhyPxYICTpNgCHJS4cgFrgB-h05/view?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gKMFWlhyPxYICTpNgCHJS4cgFrgB-h05/view?usp=drive_link)\n- Token audit - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cJ6DAXcS_DqCJzeZ3w9CvdlWBiFvlBd0/view?usp=sharing\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the NFTfi team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.",
