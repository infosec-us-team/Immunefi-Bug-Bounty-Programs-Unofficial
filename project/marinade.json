      "programOverview": "Marinade.Finance is the first non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Solana. You can stake your SOL tokens with Marinade and receive \"marinated SOL\" tokens (mSOL) that you can use in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe price of mSOL goes up relative to SOL each epoch, with rewards being accrued into the underlying staked SOL. Marinade stakes in 400+ validators that are selected automatically by an open-source fair formula based on performance, commission and decentralization.\n\nMarinade includes mSOL->SOL swap, so you can “Unstake Now!” and receive your SOL immediately with a small fee. You can also directly exchange between mSOL and SOL on secondary markets at the current rate. Finally, you can unstake your SOL with zero-fee by waiting 4-6 days for the Solana cool-down period (delayed-unstake). \n\nAs of November 2021, Marinade’s TVL is around 1.5b USD\n\nFor more information about Marinade Finance, please visit [https://marinade.finance/](https://marinade.finance/) and [https://docs.marinade.finance](https://docs.marinade.finance) \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Loss of governance funds\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds\n  - Unable to call smart contract",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain __\n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n    - including composability vulnerabilities\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n  - Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n  - Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Marinade Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __mSOL__ and __MNDE__.",
