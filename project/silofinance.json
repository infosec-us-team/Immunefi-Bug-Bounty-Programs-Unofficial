      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports and all Critical/High severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 30 000__ and a maximum of __USD 100 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 20 000__ only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than __USD 10 000__.\n\nThe following impacts/vulnerabilities are considered out of scope: \n  - Attacks caused by rebase tokens, fee-on-transfer tokens or non-standard ERC20 tokens are out of scope unless such token has deployed and configured Silo with user funds or has a pending DAO proposal for its Silo.\n  - On-chain oracle manipulation attacks (BalV2 TWAP, UniV3 TWAP and future integrations).\n  - Interest rate manipulation caused by lack of liquidity.\n  - Liquidation front-running.\n\nIn addition, known issues highlighted in audits or disclosure reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [ChainSecurity Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-vjVceL2k03jXAN_mBcEmeUbATcrrEt/view?usp=sharing)\n  - [Vulnerability Disclosure June 6, 2023](https://github.com/silo-finance/silo-core-v1/blob/master/certora/reports/06_2023_silo_certora_IRMv2.pdf)\n  - [Certora Formal Verification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D2EIOb0XaRov5Ph2AE0DTfIsMISd7UXG/view?usp=sharing)\n  - [ABDK Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WXaB3ICLv4rSEX86POK3-NaOIxXwyq9l/view?usp=sharing)\n  - [Quantstamp Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10GyfA-nBJ5jqLWW9LEYJQeFem8qSgNH6/view?usp=sharing)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Silo Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
