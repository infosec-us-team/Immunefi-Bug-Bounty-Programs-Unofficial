This can be as simplistic as calling a transaction, or as complex as requiring extensive off-chain logic. The scope of Keep3r network is not to manage these jobs themselves, but to allow contracts to register as jobs for keepers, and keepers to register themselves as available to perform jobs. It is up to the individual keeper to set up their devops and infrastructure and create their own rules based on what transactions they deem profitable.\n\nA Job is the term used to refer to a smart contract that wishes an external entity to perform an action. They would like the action to be performed in \"good will\" and not have a malicious result. For this reason they register as a job, and keepers can then execute on their contract.\n\nFor more information about Keep3r, please visit [https://keep3r.network/](https://keep3r.network/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing the loss of funds.",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nCritical smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. Other severity levels may require a PoC during the bug validation process. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are paid at 10% of economic damage, primarily based on funds at risk. The team may, at its discretion, take into consideration other aspects such as PR and branding effects. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerability rewards are further restricted to be 100% of the funds affected within this severity level. However, the minimum reward is __USD 10 000__. For vulnerabilities involving a temporary lock-up, the reward is further increased by __USD 5 000__, until the cap, for every additional 5 minutes, based on the minimum 5 minute requirement to be qualified as in-scope. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Keep3r Network__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
