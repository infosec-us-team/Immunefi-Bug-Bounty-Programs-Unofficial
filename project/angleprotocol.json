      "programOverview": "Angle is a decentralized, capital efficient and over-collateralized stablecoin protocol composed of smart contracts running on open blockchains.\n\nIt can be used to issue stablecoins, called agTokens, designed to mirror the value of an asset they are pegged to.\n\nThe protocol consists of several different modules, or sets of smart contracts, from which stablecoins can be issued or minted. While Angle launched its first stablecoin agEUR with a single minting module (the Core module - that was wound down in May 2023), a Borrowing module allowing to borrow Angle stablecoins against deposited collateral and a price stability module called Transmuter have then been introduced.\n\nThe protocol is also engaged into Direct Deposit Modules, also called Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs), allowing it to boostrap liquidity for agTokens in other protocols.\n\nFor more information about Angle Protocol, please visit [https://www.angle.money/](https://www.angle.money/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Theft of governance funds\n  - Governance activity disruption",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. All High and Medium Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward.\n\nVulnerabilities marked as “Acknowledged”, “ Accepted Risk” or “Closed” in the [ChainSecurity security review](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/angle-core/blob/main/audits/Chainsecurity%20Audit%20Report%20July%2021.pdf) from July 2021, [the Sigma Prime security review](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/angle-core/blob/main/audits/Sigma%20Prime%20Audit%20Report%20July%2021.pdf) from July 21, [the ChainSecurity security review from December 2021, the ChainSecurity security review from April 22](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits#chainsecurity-december-2021-january-2022), the [Code4rena security review from June 2023](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-06-angle) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nCritical-level smart contract vulnerabilities that result in the loss of user funds will have rewards additionally capped at 10% of the funds potentially affected based on the vulnerability that was identified. These rewards are payable in USDC or in ANGLE at the discretion of the team. ANGLE rewards will have a vesting schedule lasting between 6-12 months with a minimum of 6 months for rewards up to USD 200 000, with an additional month added for every USD 50 000 tranche, rounded up. However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Angle Protocol__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __ANGLE__ or __USDC__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.",
