This feature allows users to use other non-stable coin assets (BTC, ETH, etc.) as a margin for trading. JUSD works like DAI, and users can mint JUSD by staking other ERC20 tokens as collateral. JUSD can be freely traded. However, its price is not guaranteed equally to the Primary asset in the open market.\n\nFor more information about JUSD, please visit [https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/jusd/](https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/jusd/)\n\nJUSD provides rewards in USDT and USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nJUSD adheres to category 3.

When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nJUSD commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that JUSD will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nJUSD has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",
