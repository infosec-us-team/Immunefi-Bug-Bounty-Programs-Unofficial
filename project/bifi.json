BiFi aims to create a decentralized financial infrastructure that connects all the capital markets currently isolated on each blockchain, and creates new products and services that interoperate across multiple blockchains. \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of governance funds\n  - Thefts and freezing of permission among contracts\n  - Manipulations of the contract functionality (DoS, Malicious Re-entrancy, etc.)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain __\n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Solidity/EVM details not considered\n    - including integer over-/under-flow\n    - including rounding errors\n    - including unhandled exceptions\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n    - including composability vulnerabilities\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n  - Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n  - Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll bug reports require a PoC written in code to be eligible for a reward. Remember, you must attach a PoC written in code separately for quick analysis by our security engineers. Reports without a PoC will not be accepted, even if the issue is so obvious that a PoC is not needed. \n\nThe PoC must be reproducible, and if dependencies are required to run the PoC (e.g., Install hardhat and fork chain), the process of installing all dependencies must also be described, along with appropriate comments or explanations.\n\nFor an example of well-written PoC code, see the example below.\n\n  - [https://github.com/immunefi-team/polygon-transferwithsig?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/immunefi-team/polygon-transferwithsig?tab=readme-ov-file)\n\n\n__Readability__\n\nRemember, reports must be readable for review. If the description is lacking or difficult for the BiFi project to understand, the BiFi team may require additional clarification or reject the report. Best report may be readable to a CS engineer who knows nothing about the basic vulnerability. For complex vulnerabilities, illustrations may be helpful. \n\n__Feasibility__\n\nVulnerabilities that require manipulation outside the scope of BiFi, require administrator privileges to reproduce the attack, are non-reproducible bugs, or are not feasible for an attacker will not be rewarded.\n\nHere are examples \n\n  - Manipulation of the BiFi external pricing oracle\n  - Vulnerabilities that require gaining administrator privileges or manipulation\n  - Spending more in gas fees to execute the attack than the amount gained from the attack\n  - These are the parts of the evaluation that are excluded.\n\n__The following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:__\n\n  - Using a single on-chain price oracle as a price feed source (e.g., Uniswap, Sushiswap)\n  - Decimal discrepancy that the BiFi team is aware of \n\n__Previous Audit__\n\nBiFi has had its code audited by Theori, which are web3 security specialists. Any unresolved findings from that audit will be excluded from the rewards.\n[https://github.com/bifrost-platform/BIFI/tree/master/docs ](https://github.com/bifrost-platform/BIFI/tree/master/docs)\n\n__Vulnerability Testing__\n\nAny activity on the Mainnet or Testnet to prove or validate the above vulnerabilities is strictly prohibited. PoC activities must be performed on a forked local chain. Testing performed on-chain for a bug bounty will be excluded from the reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __BiFi__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payouts are done in __BFC, ETH, Stablecoin (USDT or USDC)__  with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.",
