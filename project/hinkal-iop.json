These researchers receive a guaranteed fee for participation and additional reward for every valid bug found. Project assets are only visible to the whitelisted researchers.**\n\nHinkal is an institutional-grade protocol enabling confidential on-chain transactions. Hinkal allows liquid funds and retail users to create private accounts and transact on major dApps in complete confidentiality (the origin and destination of transaction, value).\n\nHinkal defines the new privacy category where users have a complete private execution environment for their token experience. It means that Hinkal is not an obfuscation tool but a whole layer between the wallet and the dApps.\n\nHinkal solves major problems that privacy protocols faced before:\n\n**Compliance**. Contamination risk happens when an illicit assets commingle with others in the shielded pool. Hinkal pioneered the term \"Reusable attestation,\" which allows users to prove that they did KYC (B) somewhere on the crypto internet and use this proof to access the privacy layer.\n\n**Frictions to adoption**. Public chains proved to accumulate the value, and Hinkal plugs in the current liquidity vs L1/L2 privacy infrastructure that does not provide enough value for migration of assets.\n\nPrivacy dApps facilitated a simple function of wallet obfuscation that can be achieved using centralized exchanges. Hinkal is a separate confidential execution layer focused on providing end-to-end experience, which means that after users deposit assets to a shielded address - they have everything to keep those assets inside: buy/sell tokens on major DEXs, stake, LP, and re-stake.\n\nCurrently, Hinkal offers 6 highest TVL dApps on 6 major EVM chains.\n\nFor more information about Hinkal, please visit [https://hinkal.pro/](https://hinkal.pro/).\n\nHinkal provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD.",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n**Immunefi Standard Badge**\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Hinkal has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",
