      "programOverview": "Buttonwood is a DeFi project creating and implementing various DeFi protocols, including liquidity aggregation, price-stabilization wrappers, governance, peer-to-peer lending, and risk stratification.\n\nButtonwood’s approach to innovation focuses on composability—we believe the most useful smart contracts are building blocks, not walled gardens. They should be open-source and as minimal as possible—we seek to build primitives to be used by the entirety of digital finance, not platforms to extract value from the ecosystem. These protocols can be used and incorporated into any other protocol without restriction.\n\nFor more information about Buttonwood, please visit [https://button.foundation](https://button.foundation).\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and website and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Theft and freezing of principal\n  - Theft and freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Theft and freezing of fees\n  - Griefing of core functionality",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nCritical smart contract bug reports are further capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration the funds at risk, but also considering other aspects such as PR and branding considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__.\n\nBug reports of other severity levels will take into consideration the exploitability and impact of the bug reports had they been executed. Buttonwood reserves the right to make the final decision on the reward amount.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Buttonwood__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in  __ETH__ or __USDC__, at the discretion of the team.",
