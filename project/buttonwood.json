They should be open-source and as minimal as possible—we seek to build primitives to be used by the entirety of digital finance, not platforms to extract value from the ecosystem. These protocols can be used and incorporated into any other protocol without restriction.\n\nFor more information about Buttonwood, please visit [https://button.foundation](https://button.foundation).\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and website and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Theft and freezing of principal\n  - Theft and freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Theft and freezing of fees\n  - Griefing of core functionality",
