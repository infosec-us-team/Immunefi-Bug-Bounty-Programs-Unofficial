With pSTAKE, users can securely stake their Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets, participate in protocol improvements and security to earn staking rewards, and receive staked underlying representative tokens (stkASSETs) which can be used to explore additional yield opportunities across DeFi.\n\nBinance Labs is [supporting pSTAKE](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-makes-a-strategic-investment-in-liquid-staking-protocol-pstake-421499824684903831) to develop a liquid staking solution for the Binance chain in order to unlock liquidity of staked BNB and boost the growth of DeFi. pSTAKE’s BNB liquid staking product allows holders of BNB to stake their assets using the pSTAKE staking interface. Users are then issued stkBNB that can be used in DeFi to generate high yields.\n\nFor more information about pStake’s liquid staking product for BNB, please visit [https://pstake.finance/bnb](https://pstake.finance/bnb)\n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a **Primacy of Rules** program.",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\n__Smart Contracts Rewards Breakdowns__\n\nSmart Contracts (Critical):\n  - Loss of user funds:\n    - 10% of assets at risk, minimum __USD 50 000__, maximum __USD 300 000__\n  - Loss of non-user funds (e.g. treasury):\n    - 10% of assets at risk, minimum __USD 25 000__, maximum __USD 200 000__\n\nSmart Contracts (High):\n  - 10% of assets at risk\n  - Minimum __USD 20 000__, maximum of __USD 100 000__\n\nPrevious issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [PeckShield Audit Report](https://github.com/persistenceOne/pStake-auditReports/blob/main/stkBNB/pStake_stkBNB_Smart_Contract_Audit_Peckshield%20%5B04.07.2022%5D.pdf)\n  - [Halborn Audit Report](https://github.com/persistenceOne/pStake-auditReports/blob/main/stkBNB/pSTAKE_stkBNB_Smart_Contract_Audit_Halborn%20%5B05.08.2022%5D.pdf)\n\nIn addition, the following issue are known and considered out of scope of the program: \n\nThe gas consumed by claim __All()__ depends on the number of unstake requests made by the user calling the __claimAll()__ function. The higher the number of unstake requests made by the user, the higher the gas usage of the __claimAll()__ function will be.

With pSTAKE, users can securely stake their Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets, participate in protocol improvements and security to earn staking rewards, and receive staked underlying representative tokens (stkASSETs) which can be used to explore additional yield opportunities across DeFi.\n\n\n**Note**: This product is in its deprecation phase and will be sunsetted by the end of 2024. As a result, bounty amounts have been adjusted accordingly and are lower than usual.",

      "feasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
