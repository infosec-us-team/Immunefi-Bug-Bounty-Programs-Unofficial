With pSTAKE, users can securely stake their Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets, participate in protocol improvements and security to earn staking rewards, and receive staked underlying representative tokens (stkASSETs) which can be used to explore additional yield opportunities across DeFi.\n\nAt present, pSTAKE supports Binance (BNB), Cosmos (ATOM), Persistence (XPRT), and Ethereum (ETH) networks’ native tokens, with a view to support more chains and assets in the future (SOL, and AVAX).\n\nBinance Labs is [supporting pSTAKE](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-makes-a-strategic-investment-in-liquid-staking-protocol-pstake-421499824684903831) to develop a liquid staking solution for the Binance chain in order to unlock liquidity of staked BNB and boost the growth of DeFi. pSTAKE’s BNB liquid staking product allows holders of BNB to stake their assets using the pSTAKE staking interface. Users are then issued stkBNB that can be used in DeFi to generate high yields.\n\nFor more information about pStake’s liquid staking product for BNB, please visit [https://pstake.finance/bnb](https://pstake.finance/bnb)",

The higher the number of unstake requests made by the user, the higher the gas usage of the __claimAll()__ function will be.
