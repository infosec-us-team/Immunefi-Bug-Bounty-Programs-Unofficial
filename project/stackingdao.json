For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact). \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nStackingDAO commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that StackingDAO will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nStackingDAO’s completed audit reports can be found at [Stacking-DAO-Audit-2023-11.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m-Odj3ZM7nDZFeeLUckpuzrTKat2k14V/view?usp=sharing). Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, StackingDAO has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "__Impacts in Scope__\n\nOnly the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n__Critical__\n  - Any governance voting result manipulation\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Miner-extractable value (MEV)\n  - Insolvency\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n\n__High__\n  - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for a minimum period of 24 hours\n\n__Medium__\n  - Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of funds \n  - Block stuffing for profit\n  - Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)\n  - Theft of gas\n  - Unbounded gas consumption \n\n__Low__\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn’t lose value\n\n__Websites and Applications__\n\n__Critical__\n  - Ability to execute system commands\n  - Extract Sensitive data/files from the server such as /etc/passwd\n  - Stealing User Cookies\n  - Signing transactions for other users\n  - Redirection of user deposits and withdrawals\n  - Subdomain takeover resulting in financial loss (applicable for subdomains with addresses published)\n  - Wallet interaction modification resulting in financial loss\n  - Direct theft of user funds \n  - Tampering with transactions submitted to the user’s wallet\n  - Submitting malicious transactions to an already-connected wallet\n\n__High__\n  - Spoofing content on the target application (Persistent)\n  - Users Confidential information disclosure such as Email\n  - Subdomain Takeover without financial loss (applicable for subdomains with no addresses published)\n  - Privilege escalation to access unauthorized functionalities\n\n__Medium__\n  - Changing details of other users without direct financial impact (CSRF)\n  - Third-Party API keys leakage that demonstrates loss of funds or modification on the website.\n  - Redirecting users to malicious websites (Open Redirect)\n  - Taking Down the application/website\n\n__Low__\n  - Framing sensitive pages leading to financial loss (ClickJacking)\n  - Any impact involving a publicly released CVE without a working PoC\n  - Broken Link Hijacking\n\nIn case of discrepancy between [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2/) and Lido on Polygon’s classification above, Lido on Polygon’s classification will be followed.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi [Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 100,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 20,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n  - If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n  - For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n  - High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of __USD 1,000 to 20,000__ depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n  - In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\nFor critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 25,000__, only if the impact leads to:\n\n  - A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n  - Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of __USD 5,000__. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __StackingDAO__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __USDC on Ethereum Network__. \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
