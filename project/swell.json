This is done by staking ETH in conjunction with node operators that participate in validating the Ethereum proof-of-stake blockchain. The yield is earned through staking rewards received from the blockchain for validating block production. \n\nAbove all Swell aims to contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem and it’s users by simplifying the staking process as much as possible and driving utility for the reward-bearing token swETH.\n\nFor more information about Swell, please visit [https://swellnetwork.io/.](https://swellnetwork.io/)  \n",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of the funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.  However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ and a maximum reward of __USD 250 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nPreviously known issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered as out of scope: \n- [https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-core-public/tree/master/Audit%20Reports](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-core-public/tree/master/Audit%20Reports)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Swell__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
