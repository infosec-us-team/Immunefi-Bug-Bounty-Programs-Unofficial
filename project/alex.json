This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC in order to be considered for a reward.  Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 20 000__ paid in __ALEX__. Additionally, the maximum reward is capped at __USD 100 000)__ paid in __ALEX__, even if 10% of the damage in USD equivalent is greater than the __USD 100 000__. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [Pool / Equation](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/AlexGo_Audit_202111_Pool_Equation.pdf), [Launchpad / Vault / Reserve](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/AlexGo_Audit_202201_Launchpad_Vault_Reserve.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [DAO](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/AlexGo_Audit_202202_DAO.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [Launchpad v1.1 / AutoALEX / Collateral Rebalancing Pool](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/AlexGo_Audit_202204_Launchpadv1.1_AutoALEX_CRP.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [Bridge Endpoints](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/ALEX_Audit_bridge_coinfabrik_202212.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [Bridge backend and endpoints](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/ALEX_Audit_Bridge_2023-04.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the [Least Authority Security Review](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/Least_Authority_ALEX_Protocol_Smart_Contracts_Final_Audit_Report.pdf) \n\nALEX requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed are Name, Email address, Stacks wallet address, and Identity Proof (Passport, / Driving License / National ID).
