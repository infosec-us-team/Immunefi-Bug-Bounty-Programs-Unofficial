As such, we focus on trading, lending and borrowing of crypto assets with Bitcoin as the settlement layer and Stacks as the smart contract layer. At the core of this focus is the automated market making (\"AMM\") protocol, which allows users to exchange one crypto asset with another trustlessly.\n\nFor more information about ALEX, please visit [https://alexgo.io/](https://alexgo.io/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Theft of governance funds \n  - Governance activity disruption",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "__Impacts in Scope__\n\nOnly the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n__Critical__\n  - Any governance voting result manipulation\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Miner-extractable value (MEV)\n  - Protocol insolvency\n\n__High__\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for a minimum period of 1 day",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC in order to be considered for a reward.  Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 20 000__ paid in __ALEX__. Additionally, the maximum reward is capped at __USD 100 000)__ paid in __ALEX__, even if 10% of the damage in USD equivalent is greater than the __USD 100 000__. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [Pool / Equation](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/AlexGo_Audit_202111_Pool_Equation.pdf), [Launchpad / Vault / Reserve](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/AlexGo_Audit_202201_Launchpad_Vault_Reserve.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [DAO](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/AlexGo_Audit_202202_DAO.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [Launchpad v1.1 / AutoALEX / Collateral Rebalancing Pool](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/AlexGo_Audit_202204_Launchpadv1.1_AutoALEX_CRP.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [Bridge Endpoints](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/ALEX_Audit_bridge_coinfabrik_202212.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the CoinFabrik Security Review [Bridge backend and endpoints](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/ALEX_Audit_Bridge_2023-04.pdf)\n  - All vulnerabilities marked in the [Least Authority Security Review](https://cdn.alexlab.co/pdf/Least_Authority_ALEX_Protocol_Smart_Contracts_Final_Audit_Report.pdf) \n\nALEX requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed are Name, Email address, Stacks wallet address, and Identity Proof (Passport, / Driving License / National ID). The collection of this information will be done by the ALEX team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __ALEX__ team directly. Payouts are done in __ALEX__. \n",
