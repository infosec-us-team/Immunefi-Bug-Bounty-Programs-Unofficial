Through the power of open source software, the harnessing of underutilized resources like compute and bandwidth, and the use of cryptoeconomic incentives for bootstrapping and participation, there is an opportunity to deliver an infrastructure that can power video streaming applications at a highly efficient price, and infinite scale.\n\nFor more information about Livepeer, please visit [https://livepeer.org/](https://livepeer.org/).  \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Insolvency\n  - Unintended issuance of LPT on L1\n  - Unexpected calls to functions that should only be called by authorized addresses (i.e. Governor)",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nAll vulnerabilities marked in the [security review](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-01-livepeer) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nLivepeer requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is Visual Proof of Identity. The collection of this information will be done by the project team. \n\nRewards for critical vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of the economic damage (following the linked examples) with the primary focus on possible loss of funds for Orchestrators, Delegators and Broadcasters at the Smart Contract level only. If there is a repeatable attack, only the first attack is considered unless further attacks cannot be mitigated via an upgrade or pause.\n\nRewards for high vulnerabilities will depend on the amount of unclaimed yield that is on the line and how long the funds can be frozen.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Livepeer__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.",
