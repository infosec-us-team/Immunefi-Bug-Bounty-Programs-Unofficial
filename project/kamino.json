  "programOverview": "Kamino is a first-of-its-kind DeFi protocol that unifies Lending, Liquidity, and Leverage into a single, secure DeFi product suite.\n\nFor more information about Kamino, please visit https://kamino.finance/.\n\nKamino provides rewards in USDC on SOL, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nKamino will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nKamino adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Smart Contract  —  Critical\n- Smart Contract  —  High\n- Website & Application  —  Critical\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nKamino’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/Kamino-Finance/audits](https://github.com/Kamino-Finance/audits). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",

  "rewardsBody": "__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $1,500,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $150,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report. There needs to be an absolute minimum of USD 50 000 at risk in order to be considered `Critical`. In any other case the impact will be downgraded to `High`.\n\nFor critical web/apps bugs, reports will be rewarded with $50,000, only if the impact leads to:\n\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of $20,000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh impacts concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of $10,000 to $100,000 with the reward calculated based on 100% of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward. \n\nIf the duration of temporary freezing is 9,000 blocks or less, then the severity level will be reduced to `Medium` if the amount is equal to or greater than **USD 100 000**. If not, the severity level will be downgraded to `Low`. There needs to be a minimum of **USD 5 000** at risk in order for a report to be considered `High`.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Kamino team directly and are denominated in **USD**. However, payments are done in **USDC** on **SOL**.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",

  "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
