The scope, terms and rewards are at the sole discretion of the TruFin Protocol.\n\nFor more information about TruFin, please visit [https://trufin.io.](https://trufin.io) \n\nTruFin provides rewards in __USDC__. For more details about the payment process, please view the __Rewards by Threat Level__ section. \n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nTruFin adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nTruFin has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",

Any issue related to slashing for other stakers will not be considered.\n- Apart from the Solana staker, all TruFin stakers offer an allocation feature that enables a user to allocate rewards from the staked token. The amount allocated may exceed the total value currently staked by the user, which is fine. The user will still be required to have enough tokens in their wallet at the point at which distributions are made, hence no issue related to users not having enough to cover allocation’s distributions will be considered a bug.\n- MATIC staker only: Issues related to changing the privacy status of validators will not be considered as these are managed by the contract’s owners and only subject to be used in rare conditions.\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Trufin team directly and are denominated in USD.
