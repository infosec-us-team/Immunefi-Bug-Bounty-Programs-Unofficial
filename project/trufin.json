      "programOverview": "The TruFin Protocol builds institutional-grade DeFi primitives that can be used as the foundational building blocks for complex digital asset strategies to reduce risk while generating rewards, securely on-chain.\n\nTruStake vaults provide access to liquid staking on a range of networks:\n\n- MATIC staking on the Ethereum network,\n- APT staking on the Aptos network,\n- NEAR staking on the NEAR network.\n\nThe TruStake vaults have custom functionality that enables the allocation of rewards to designated wallet addresses, as well as auto-restaking that compounds rewards for higher APY.\n\nIn exchange for depositing assets in a TruStake vault, users receive liquid staking tokens: TruMATIC, TruAPT and TruNEAR for MATIC, APT and NEAR, respectively.\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused around the TruStake smart contracts and whitelists and is primarily concerned with the loss of user funds.\n\nRewards are allocated based on the severity of the bug disclosed. The scope, terms and rewards are at the sole discretion of the TruFin Protocol.\n\nFor more information about TruFin, please visit [https://trufin.io.](https://trufin.io) \n\nTruFin provides rewards in __USDC__. For more details about the payment process, please view the __Rewards by Threat Level__ section. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nTruFin adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nTruFin adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nTruFin has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n\n- The contract assumes that there is no slashing for validators on any of the supported chains (as it is currently the case). Any issue related to slashing will not be considered.\n- The TruFin vault offers an allocation feature that enables a user to allocate rewards from the staked token. The amount allocated may exceed the total value currently staked by the user, which is fine. The user will still be required to have enough tokens in their wallet at the point at which distributions are made, hence no issue related to users not having enough to cover allocation’s distributions will be considered a bug.\n- Issues related to changing the privacy status of validators will not be considered as these are managed by the contract’s owners and only subject to be used in rare conditions.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nBug reports that require an attack that involve one or more other protocols (e.g. utilizing flash loans from a margin protocol or manipulating the spot prices on a DEX), either to make an attack more severe than it would be in isolation, or to achieve an attack that would otherwise be impossible or infeasible, would be both a reduction in the severity level and a corresponding decrease in the payout. However, they will be considered as in-scope and categorized according to the program rules as long as all of the following are true:\n- Losses or other negative effects of the attack are inflicted upon TruFin ecosystem participants. \n- The additional protocols used must have enough liquidity in various assets to allow the attack to succeed at the time of bug report submission. For example: if an attack requires an ETH flash loan, but the amount is larger than all the ETH available for loan across the ecosystem\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Trufin team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.",
