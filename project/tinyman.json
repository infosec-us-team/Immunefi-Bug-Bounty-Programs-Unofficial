      "programOverview": "Tinyman is a decentralised exchange (DEX) on Algorand. More specifically, it is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) exchange employing the Constant Product Market Maker algorithm.\n\nThe exchange is fully decentralized and non-custodial. Funds are held in permissionless smart contract accounts. This means the only methods to withdraw funds from the pool accounts are those encoded in the smart contract. At a high level this code only allows withdrawals in exchange for an appropriate amount of another asset or by the liquidity owners in exchange for their Pool Tokens.\n\nFurthermore the contracts are fully permissionless. This means that any account can create a pool by issuing the correct set of transactions. It means that no account has authority over the pool's assets or functionality. This also means there is no mechanism to revert or adjust transactions even if they are made in error.\n\nThe contracts are also fully immutable. This means no account has the authority to update or delete the contracts that control the pools. This means that funds cannot be stolen by an update to the contracts.\n\nFor more information about Tinyman, please visit [https://tinyman.org/](https://tinyman.org/).\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of liquidity pools\n  - Unauthorized and fraudulent calls to Tinyman v1.1 smart contracts",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System](https://immunefi.com/severity-updated). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nNo PoC is required, but all bug reports must be detailed with either step-by-step exploit instructions or pointers to specific lines of code in order to be considered for a reward. The Tinyman team may ask for further explanations for bug reports to prove validity. \n\nTinyman will also issue an NFT reward for valid High severity reports, and a single edition Tinyman NFT reward for valid Critical severity reports.\n\nThe following impacts are considered to be out of scope of this bug bounty program: \n  - Issues due to Freeze or Clawback of pooled assets\n  - Rounding issues when swapping/minting/burning with <1000 microunits of an asset\n  - Overflow errors when attempting to swap/mint/burn very large amounts \n  - Attacks against accounts not created from the Pool LogicSig Template\n  - MEV style attacks\n  - Pool ratio/price manipulation due to donations to the pool account\n\nAll known issues listed here are also considered as out-of-scope of the bug bounty program: [https://github.com/tinymanorg/docs/tree/main/known-issues](https://github.com/tinymanorg/docs/tree/main/known-issues).   \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Tinyman__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ or __ALGO__, at the discretion of the team.",
