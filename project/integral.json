      "programOverview": "At Integral we build on-chain trading products and tools to rival those of centralized exchanges. Our mission is to serve DeFi users who care about self-custody, decentralization, security, and financial usability. Integral SIZE is a TWAP based DEX with zero price impact swaps on Ethereum. In addition, traders enjoy a MEV-resistant and low-fee trading experience. Further information about Integral can be found here [https://docs.integral.link](https://docs.integral.link).\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with:\n\n  - Direct theft of any user funds from smart contracts, whether at-rest or in-motion\n  - Loss of user funds through freezing, theft, manipulation of the pools, or denial of service to smart contracts.\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the\nfollowing types:\n\n**Smart Contracts/Blockchain:**\n\n- Re-entrancy\n- Logic errors\n  - including user authentication errors\n- Solidity/EVM details not considered\n  - including integer over-/under-flow\n  - including unhandled exceptions\n- Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - including composability vulnerabilities\n- Oracle failure/manipulation\n- Novel governance attacks\n- Economic/financial attacks\n  - including flash loan attacks\n- Congestion and scalability\n  - including running out of gas\n  - including block stuffing\n  - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n- Consensus failures\n- Cryptography problems\n  - Signature malleability\n  - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n  - Weak randomness\n  - Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on\nthe [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. All bug reports without a PoC will not be accepted under this bug bounty program.\n\nThe final reward for critical bounty payouts is capped at 10% of economic damage up to USD 25 000, primarily based on the funds at risk, at the discretion of the team. However, the minimum reward is USD 10 000.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\nThe following scenarios are not eligible for a reward:\n  - Exploits that require access to the admin keys\n  - Cases involving risks of losses to the pools in case the assets in the pools decrease in price\n  - Cases involving risks of impermanent losses in the pools\n  - Exploits or arbitrages which are not economically practical to execute\n  - Exploits or arbitrages which rely on predicting future price movements, and/or price differentials between either the delay or the relayer contract, and other on-chain or off-chain venues regardless of whether it is realistic to execute such exploits or arbitrages.\n  - Cases involving dynamic pool ratios due to the nature of the design\n  - Cases involving dynamic pool ratios due to the nature of the design including but not limited to large changes of pool ratios due to orderflow, temporary guardrail pauses on LP withdrawal when pool ratios are extremely skewed. \n  - Exploits due to issues with hosting providers which cannot be fixed by changing any configuration on our side will be given an Informational classification or lower, these exploits should be reported using the bug bounty program of the hosting providers instead\n\nPayouts are handled by the Integral team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in DAI, USDT, USDC, ETH, or ITGR, at the discretion of the team.\n",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
