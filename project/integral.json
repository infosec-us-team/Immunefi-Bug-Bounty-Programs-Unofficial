In addition, traders enjoy a MEV-resistant and low-fee trading experience. Further information about Integral can be found here [https://docs.integral.link](https://docs.integral.link).\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with:\n\n  - Direct theft of any user funds from smart contracts, whether at-rest or in-motion\n  - Loss of user funds through freezing, theft, manipulation of the pools, or denial of service to smart contracts.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the\nfollowing types:\n\n**Smart Contracts/Blockchain:**\n\n- Re-entrancy\n- Logic errors\n  - including user authentication errors\n- Solidity/EVM details not considered\n  - including integer over-/under-flow\n  - including unhandled exceptions\n- Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - including composability vulnerabilities\n- Oracle failure/manipulation\n- Novel governance attacks\n- Economic/financial attacks\n  - including flash loan attacks\n- Congestion and scalability\n  - including running out of gas\n  - including block stuffing\n  - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n- Consensus failures\n- Cryptography problems\n  - Signature malleability\n  - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n  - Weak randomness\n  - Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces\n\n\n__Eligibility__\n\nTo be eligible for a reward under this Program, you must:\n  - Be the first to disclose the unique vulnerability in compliance with the disclosure requirements above.\n  - Provide sufficient information to enable our team to reproduce and fix the vulnerability.\n  - Not engage in any unlawful conduct when disclosing the bug including through threats, demands, or any other coercive tactics.\n  - Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, interruption or degradation of Integral.\n  - Submit only one vulnerability per submission, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact regarding any of the vulnerabilities.\n  - Not submit a vulnerability caused by an underlying issue that is the same as an issue on which a reward has been paid under this Program.\n  - Be at least 18 years of age.\n  - Comply with all the eligibility and disclosure requirements of the Program.\n  - The vulnerability must not already be known by the Integral team.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on\nthe [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. All bug reports without a PoC will not be accepted under this bug bounty program.\n\nThe final reward for critical bounty payouts is capped at 10% of economic damage up to USD 25 000, primarily based on the funds at risk, at the discretion of the team. However, the minimum reward is USD 10 000.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\nThe following scenarios are not eligible for a reward:\n  - Exploits that require access to the admin keys\n  - Cases involving risks of losses to the pools in case the assets in the pools decrease in price\n  - Cases involving risks of impermanent losses in the pools\n  - Exploits or arbitrages which are not economically practical to execute\n  - Exploits or arbitrages which rely on predicting future price movements, and/or price differentials between either the delay or the relayer contract, and other on-chain or off-chain venues regardless of whether it is realistic to execute such exploits or arbitrages.\n  - Cases involving dynamic pool ratios due to the nature of the design\n  - Cases involving dynamic pool ratios due to the nature of the design including but not limited to large changes of pool ratios due to orderflow, temporary guardrail pauses on LP withdrawal when pool ratios are extremely skewed. \n  - Exploits due to issues with hosting providers which cannot be fixed by changing any configuration on our side will be given an Informational classification or lower, these exploits should be reported using the bug bounty program of the hosting providers instead\n\nPayouts are handled by the Integral team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in DAI, USDT, USDC, ETH, or ITGR, at the discretion of the team.",
