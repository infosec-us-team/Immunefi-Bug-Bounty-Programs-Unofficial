      "programOverview": "The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying decentralized data from multiple blockchains and storage solutions such as IPFS. It is a decentralized network comprised of multiple stakeholders incentivized to build and offer an efficient and reliable open data marketplace, through GraphQL-based APIs.\n\nThe Graph learns what and how to index Blockchain data based on subgraph descriptions, known as the subgraph manifest. The subgraph description defines the smart contracts of interest for a subgraph, the events in those contracts to pay attention to, and how to map data to data that The Graph will index and store in its decentralized network, to be served by Indexers. Indexers are network participants responsible for running their own infrastructure capable of indexing subgraphs and subsequently serve such data.\n\nThe network is fully permissionless, meaning that every stakeholder can design, implement and deploy subgraphs, with Indexers choosing which subgraphs to index based on a number of factors such as Curators’ interest (signaling high-quality ones which may result in high query volume). Delegators are another key network participant in this open data economy, who delegate their stake towards Indexers, receiving, in turn, a portion of both network rewards and fees from subsequently served queries. Like Delegators, Curators also receive a portion of the query fees, when staking their own GRT in a subgraph’s bounding curve (signaling).\n\nFor more information about The Graph, please visit their website at [https://thegraph.com/](https://thegraph.com/). \n\nThe bug bounty program, managed and funded by The Graph Foundation, is focused on the prevention of negative impacts to the whole ecosystem, such as:\n\n  - Loss of user funds from the protocol smart contracts\n  - Exposure of private keys that may lead to changes on deployed smart contracts and/or drainage of user funds\n  - Determinism bugs that could lead to incorrect or inconsistent query results by Indexers in the network\n  - Vulnerabilities in the Indexer software (eg. Graph Node, Indexer CLI,    Indexer Agent, and Indexer Service) that could result in the Indexer being slashed or not running effectively\n  - Vulnerabilities that could degrade the indexing or querying service\n  - Bugs that could facilitate Sybil attacks\n\nBug bounty hunters submit bug reports at their own risk of being rejected as a known issue. \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "__Rules and Requirements__\n\nAll bounty hunters must abide by rules when reporting bugs to be eligible for rewards. We appreciate your cooperation.\n\n__Report Responsibly__\n\nReport vulnerabilities to The Graph first by submitting a bug report on Immunefi, to mitigate attacks and in the best interest of the network’s safety. Give reasonable time for The Graph to fix the bug before sharing publicly.\n\n__Don't Exploit Reported Bugs__\n\nDo not exploit bugs in the code to gain an advantage or conduct malicious activity in the network. No hacking or social engineering of other network users.\n\n__Don’t Violate Privacy__\n\nDo not violate the privacy of network users, other bounty hunters, or The Graph.\n\n__Don’t Attack or Defraud The Graph__\n\nDo not attack The Graph team, operations, or technology (eg. DDOS attack, spam, social engineering) or defraud The Graph team or network users.\n\n__Please also note reporting requirements:__\n\n  - Bugs will only be rewarded once for successful reporting and confirmation of fix to the first person to report the bug.\n\n  - Vulnerabilities must be reproducible by The Graph team (please include all relevant links, docs, and code)\n\n  - Single vulnerabilities can be submitted per report, multiple submissions for the same vulnerability will not be counted. In case the same vulnerability and/or exploit applies to different assets in scope, these must be mentioned in a single report.\n\n  - Bounty hunters can submit multiple bug reports\n\n  - Public disclosure of the vulnerability prior to resolution may cancel a pending reward. We reserve the right to disqualify individuals from the program for disrespectful or disruptive behavior.\n\n  - The Graph and affiliates will not negotiate in response to duress or threats (e.g., we will not negotiate the payout amount under threat of withholding the vulnerability or threat of releasing the vulnerability or any exposed data to the public).",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from the consequence of exploitation to privilege required to the likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nRewards for critical vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of the potential direct economic damage at the time the vulnerability is disclosed, primarily focusing on the USD value of Indexer, Delegator, or Curator assets in any impacted protocol smart contracts at the time of disclosure and the likelihood that such assets could be lost or stolen. The Graph Foundation may also in its discretion, but is not required to, take into consideration other potential economic harms such as potential damage to brand and goodwill. Indirect or speculative potential damage will not be considered.\n\nFinal reward amount for a valid report classified as High, Medium, and Low is in the sole discretion of The Graph Foundation. Though this bug bounty program considers the severity classification system, the primary baseline before further consideration is the Impacts in Scope and Assets in Scope tables, though that itself isn’t the final determinant.\n\nTo qualify for a reward, bug bounty hunters will need to provide KYC through [https://register.thegraph.com](https://register.thegraph.com) and provide all requested information and documents, including, without limitation:\n  - E-mail address;\n  - Name;\n  - Wallet address the GRT should be sent to. This address must correspond with the same listed in the report. \n\nAdditionally, all bug reports must come with log components, reproduction, and data about vulnerabilities to support learnings and bug fixes. This can be satisfied by providing relevant screenshots, docs, code, and steps to reproduce the issue.\n\n__Proof of Concept required for Smart Contracts and Blockchain__\nIn the case of smart contract bugs, sharing a valid reproducible script as Proof of Concept (PoC) is a strict requirement. All PoCs must be submitted complying with Immunefi’s PoC Guidelines and Rules. Failing to do so will result in a report being deemed invalid by The Graph Foundation, not eligible for any reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by __The Graph Foundation__ and are denominated in __USD__ and payable in __GRT__ based on the prevailing __USD/GRT__ conversion price at the time of payment.\n",
