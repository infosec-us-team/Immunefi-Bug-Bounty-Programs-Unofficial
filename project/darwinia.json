      "programOverview": "Darwinia operates as a community-managed technology and service provider, concentrating on powering the cross-chain functionalities of decentralized apps.\n\nDarwinia Msgport:  A cross-chain message protocol, introduces a universal set of smart contract interfaces for seamless message exchange across EVM-compatible blockchains. This innovation simplifies the development of interoperable applications, leveraging the power of cross-chain communication.\n\nFor more information about Darwinia Network, please visit [https://darwinia.network/](https://darwinia.network/)\n\nItering provides open-source technology development and security services for the Darwinia network and Darwinia network utilizes the services of Immunefi via Itering. Itering provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nItering will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n  - Full name \n  - Date of birth\n  - Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n  - Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__ \n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n  - On OFACs SDN list \n  - Official contributor, both past or present\n  - Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n  - Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nItering adheres to category 3 - __Approval Required__. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nItering adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nItering  commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Itering will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Darwinia Network has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "__Impacts in Scope__\n\nOnly the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n__Critical__\n  - Any governance voting result manipulation\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Miner-extractable value (MEV)\n  - Insolvency\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n\n__High__\n  - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for a minimum period of 24 hours\n\n__Medium__\n  - Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of funds \n  - Block stuffing for profit\n  - Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)\n  - Theft of gas\n  - Unbounded gas consumption \n\n__Low__\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn’t lose value\n\n__Websites and Applications__\n\n__Critical__\n  - Ability to execute system commands\n  - Extract Sensitive data/files from the server such as /etc/passwd\n  - Stealing User Cookies\n  - Signing transactions for other users\n  - Redirection of user deposits and withdrawals\n  - Subdomain takeover resulting in financial loss (applicable for subdomains with addresses published)\n  - Wallet interaction modification resulting in financial loss\n  - Direct theft of user funds \n  - Tampering with transactions submitted to the user’s wallet\n  - Submitting malicious transactions to an already-connected wallet\n\n__High__\n  - Spoofing content on the target application (Persistent)\n  - Users Confidential information disclosure such as Email\n  - Subdomain Takeover without financial loss (applicable for subdomains with no addresses published)\n  - Privilege escalation to access unauthorized functionalities\n\n__Medium__\n  - Changing details of other users without direct financial impact (CSRF)\n  - Third-Party API keys leakage that demonstrates loss of funds or modification on the website.\n  - Redirecting users to malicious websites (Open Redirect)\n  - Taking Down the application/website\n\n__Low__\n  - Framing sensitive pages leading to financial loss (ClickJacking)\n  - Any impact involving a publicly released CVE without a working PoC\n  - Broken Link Hijacking\n\nIn case of discrepancy between [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2/) and Lido on Polygon’s classification above, Lido on Polygon’s classification will be followed.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi [Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is __10%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 10 000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n  - If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n  - For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n  - High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of __USD 3 000 to USD 5 000__ depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n  - In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Itering__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __USDC__.",
