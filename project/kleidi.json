  "programOverview": "The Kleidi Wallet is a collection of smart contracts that can be used to create a full self-custody wallet system for DeFi users. The protocol enables users to access DeFi yields and protocols, pull funds in case of emergency, and recover funds in case of lost keys either through social recovery or predefined backups.\n\nA Timelock module enforces time-delayed execution on all Safe transactions, a Gnosis Guard contract prevents the Safe from bypassing the Timelock, and Recovery Spells enable emergency owner rotation via EIP-712 signatures. Hot signers can execute pre-approved operations immediately through an on-chain calldata whitelisting engine. The system is deployed deterministically via CREATE2, so all contracts share the same addresses across Ethereum, Base, and Optimism. Kleidi Timelocks hold user-deposited ERC-20 tokens and native ETH.\n\nFor more information about Kleidi, please visit [https://kleidi.io/](https://kleidi.io/).\n\nKleidi provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nKleidi adheres to  Category 2: Notice Required . This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nKleidi adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\nSmart Contract  —  Critical\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n[https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/kleidi/blob/main/docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/kleidi/blob/main/docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md)\n\n[https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/kleidi/blob/main/docs/EDGECASES.md](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/kleidi/blob/main/docs/EDGECASES.md)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nKleidi’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/kleidi/tree/main/audit](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/kleidi/tree/main/audit). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",

  "rewardsBody": "__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of **USD 50 000**.  The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of **USD 5 000** is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward.\n- The amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at **100%** and then a reduction of **25%** from the amount of the first attack for every **[300 blocks]** the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Kleidi team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
