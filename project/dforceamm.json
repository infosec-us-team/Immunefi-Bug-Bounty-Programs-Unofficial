      "programOverview": "dForce advocates for building a complete set of DeFi protocols covering assets, lending, and trading, serving as DeFi infrastructure in Web 3.\n\ndForce is currently deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and KAVA.\n\nFor more information about dForce, please visit [https://dforce.network/.](https://dforce.network/) \n\ndForce provides rewards in DF. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\ndForce AMM adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\ndForce AMM adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- (Smart Contracts) Critical severity, Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n- (Smart Contracts) Critical severity, Permanent freezing of funds\n- (Smart Contracts) Critical severity, Protocol insolvency\n- (Smart Contracts) High severity, Temporary freezing of funds\n- (Smart Contracts) Medium severity, Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds\n- (Smart Contracts) Medium severity, Theft of gas\n- (Smart Contracts) Medium severity, Unbounded gas consumption\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n  __Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract Critical Severity\n- Smart Contract High Severity\n- Smart Contract Medium Severity\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the [Immunefi-wide PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the dForce team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in DF. \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n",
