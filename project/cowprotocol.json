Determinations of eligibility, score, and all terms related to an award are at the sole and final discretion of the CoW team bug bounty panel, on behalf of CoW DAO.\n\nThe CoW core team (whether paid directly or indirectly, incl. Grant Core Contributor and including external auditors) including current and former team members, which includes anyone currently or formerly paid by CoW DAO or its Service Providers as well as Gnosis, are not eligible for rewards.\n\nIn order to be eligible for a reward, bug reports must include an explanation of how the bug can be reproduced, a failing test case, a valid scenario in which the bug can be exploited. Critical vulnerabilities with all of these have a maximum reward of __USD 1 000 000__. \n\nPayouts are processed on behalf of and at the expense of CoW DAO and are denominated in __USD__. However, payouts are done in ETH, on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nOnce the CoW team bug bounty panel accepts an eligible bug, the team shall have the right to decide on and implement the mitigation and publishing steps of the eligible bug on their own terms and timeline.\nBy submitting a bug report on this platform, the submitter agrees to extend our timeline for resolving the issue (and to not disclose the report elsewhere or to any other party keeping the information confidential and without exploiting the vulnerability).",
