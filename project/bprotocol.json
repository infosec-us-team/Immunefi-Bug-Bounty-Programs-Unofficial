      "programOverview": "__B.Protocol runs a Backstopp AMM (BAMM) as a robust liquidation engine solution for DeFi lending platforms.__ \n\nB.Protocol’s BAMM is a novel DeFi primitive, providing better stability, and unlocking higher capital efficiency in the DeFi lending ecosystem. The protocol enables anyone to participate in the liquidation processes in DeFi, helping to maintain the supported platforms safe, while democratizing the process.\n\nB.Protocol pools users’ funds into Backstop pools. This liquidity is used for liquidations as they happen on integrated platforms. While the Backstop funds are sitting idle in the pools waiting for liquidation to occur, they gain either interest rates or liquidity mining rewards, or both, generating passive revenue for the Backstoppers - users who provide liquidity to the Backstop pools.\nOnce a liquidation takes place, the Backstop AMM (BAMM) smart contract pulls the needed funds from the backstop to facilitate the liquidation and automatically puts the seized collateral for sale. Once sold, the return is deposited back to the backstop pool, and profits are accrued.\n\nFor more information about BProtocol, please visit [https://www.bprotocol.org/](https://www.bprotocol.org/). \n\nThe bug bounty program covers its smart contracts and is focused on the prevention of the negative impacts stated in the Impacts in Scope section.\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into account the funds at risk. Other considerations such as PR and branding concerns may also be considered by the team at its discretion. \n\nPaid auditor(s) of this code is(are) not eligible for rewards in this table.  Determinations of eligibility and final reward amount (for critical vulnerabilities) and all terms related to an award are at the sole and final discretion of the B.Protocol team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __BProtocol__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in __USDC__ or __DAI__ for payouts up to USD 10 000 and BPRO/stablecoin mix (90%/10%) for all other critical payouts, capped by up to 50 000 BPRO.",
