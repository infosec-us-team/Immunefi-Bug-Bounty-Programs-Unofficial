This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered to be out-of-scope: \n  - [https://github.com/octopus-network/octopus-appchain-registry/blob/main/Octopus_Network_NEAR_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/octopus-network/octopus-appchain-registry/blob/main/Octopus_Network_NEAR_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf) \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Octopus Network__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
