To that end, it offers\nsolutions to meet the needs of different types of users: a fully\nBitcoin-collateralized stablecoin (DoC), a Bitcoin on steroids conceived for\nthe long term bitcoin holder (BPro), and a dizzying bitcoiner option for lovers\nof leveraged trading (BTCx). All this, without requiring the delivery of\nprivate keys. To make this possible, we developed a unique\nmathematical-financial model with proven robustness, even in extreme market\nsituations.
