      "programOverview": "Alpaca Finance is the largest lending protocol allowing leveraged yield farming on Binance Smart Chain. It helps lenders to earn safe and stable yields, and offers borrowers undercollateralized loans for leveraged yield farming positions, vastly multiplying their farming principals and resulting profits.\n\nFurthermore, Alpacas are a virtuous breed. That’s why, Alpaca is a fair-launch project with no pre-sale, no investor, and no pre-mine. So from the beginning, it has always been a product built by the people, for the people. Or as they like to say: by the Alpacas, for the Alpacas.\n\nMore information about Alpaca Finance can be found on their website, [https://www.alpacafinance.org/](https://www.alpacafinance.org/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Solidity/EVM details not considered\n    - including integer over-/under-flow\n    - including unhandled exceptions\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n    - including composability vulnerabilities\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards for Smart Contract vulnerabilities are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nThe amount of funds at risk affects the final severity classification of the bug report. A vulnerability resulting in the direct loss of protocol funds of 10% or greater remains classified as Critical. However, they are reclassified as High if the impact is less than 10% but greater than 0.1%. If the impact is less than 0.1%, they are reclassified as Medium.\n\nBug reports are required to include a complete issue description and instructions to reproduce the issue or a PoC. Reports that include a solution to fix the problem have a higher likelihood of receiving the full reward under the respective severity classification tier. \n\nThe final reward is determined at the sole discretion of the Alpaca Finance team. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Alpaca Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__.",
