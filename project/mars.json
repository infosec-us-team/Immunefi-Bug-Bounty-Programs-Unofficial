      "programOverview": "Mars Protocol consists of a money market, called Red Bank, and a generalized credit primitive called Credit Accounts. Mars Protocol utilizes a so-called hub and outpost topology, whereby its base, Mars Hub is the command center for Mars outposts. Each outpost can consist of instances of Red Bank and/or Credit Accounts. The first outpost containing both Red bank and Credit Accounts (dubbed Mars v2) is on Osmosis, and the second outpost which currently contains only the Red Bank is deployed to Neutron.\n\nBuilt for the Cosmos ecosystem, Mars Protocol is Built using the Cosmos SDK. Mars Hub will serve as the homebase for all of Mars’ outposts throughout the Cosmos galaxy. Each outpost consists of an instance of Red Bank and optionally Credit Accounts, which are deployed onto independent chains. Outposts are bound together by Mars Hub which is responsible for governance and treasury including protocol revenue distribution.\n\nA new MARS token was minted on Mars Hub and will circulate freely throughout the Cosmos ecosystem. \n\nFor more information about the Mars Protocol, please visit [whitepaper.marsprotocol.io](http://whitepaper.marsprotocol.io).  \n",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical blockchain/DLT and critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of mainnet economic damage potentially caused. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 20 000__ and a maximum reward of __USD 100 000__. \n\nAll issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope of the program: \n- [Audits reports for Mars Hub, Periphery contracts and the Mars outposts](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits)\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Mars Protocol Foundation and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in MARS.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.\n",

(where applicable)\n- DoS related attacks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n- Any testing with mainnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets. Any testing on public testnets should be done with care to not disclose vulnerabilities to blackhats.\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n",
