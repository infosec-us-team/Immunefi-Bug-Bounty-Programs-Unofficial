      "programOverview": "Maya Protocol is a decentralized multi-chain liquidity protocol built as a fork of THORChain, providing seamless cross-chain asset exchanges while maintaining transparency and security. It utilizes Cosmos-SDK, Tendermint, and Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) to ensure a robust and reliable platform. With a unique Liquidity Auction design and a dual-token model ($CACAO and $MAYA), the protocol ensures fair distribution and encourages user participation.\n\nMaya Protocol leverages an innovative approach to node operations, combining bonded $CACAO tokens with other native assets in liquidity pools to maximize capital efficiency and security. This design allows node operators to earn both Liquidity Provider rewards and Validator Rewards, making the protocol more attractive for user engagement and investment.\n\nThis program covers the protocol's core functionality, and other critical aspects, focusing on receiving bug reports for vulnerabilities with potentially significant impacts on users and the system.\n\nFor more information about how Maya Protocol works, please visit [https://docs.mayaprotocol.com](https://docs.mayaprotocol.com) \n\n__For Whitehats__: It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)",

      "rewardsBody": "Please review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements:__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Maya Protocol team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in USDC and USDT.  Whitehats also have a choice to get paid in BTC, RUNE, CACAO, and/or MAYA. Maya Protocol commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Rules program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact). \n\n__KYC Requirements:__\n\nMaya Protocol __does not__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues:__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n- [https://docs.mayaprotocol.com/audits](https://docs.mayaprotocol.com/audits)",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following impacts and attack vectors are excluded from rewards by default for all Immunefi bug bounty programs: \n\n- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist), except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Broken link hijacking is out of scope\n- Attacks that are covered by Thorchain either in a future version or that are currently reviewing privately\n- No double-dipping\n- Centralization risks\n\n__Prohibited Activities:__\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program. Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: 1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and 2) zero payout. \n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited: \n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n- [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules](https://immunefi.com/rules/).
