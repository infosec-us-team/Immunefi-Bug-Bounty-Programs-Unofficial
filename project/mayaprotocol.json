      "programOverview": "Maya Protocol is a decentralized multi-chain liquidity protocol built as a fork of THORChain, providing seamless cross-chain asset exchanges while maintaining transparency and security. It utilizes Cosmos-SDK, Tendermint, and Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) to ensure a robust and reliable platform. With a unique Liquidity Auction design and a dual-token model ($CACAO and $MAYA), the protocol ensures fair distribution and encourages user participation.\n\nMaya Protocol leverages an innovative approach to node operations, combining bonded $CACAO tokens with other native assets in liquidity pools to maximize capital efficiency and security. This design allows node operators to earn both Liquidity Provider rewards and Validator Rewards, making the protocol more attractive for user engagement and investment.\n\nThis program covers the protocol's core functionality, and other critical aspects, focusing on receiving bug reports for vulnerabilities with potentially significant impacts on users and the system.\n\nFor more information about how Maya Protocol works, please visit [https://docs.mayaprotocol.com](https://docs.mayaprotocol.com) \n\nWe are an open-source, community-driven protocol with a 100% fair launch where all tokens were distributed to the community under equal terms. This transparent and equitable approach to token distribution reflects our commitment to true decentralization and community ownership\n\n__For Whitehats__: It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only those listed in the Assets in Scope table are considered to be in-scope of the bug bounty program.",
      "rewardsBody": "Please review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements:__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Maya Protocol team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in USDC and USDT.  Whitehats also have a choice to get paid in BTC, RUNE, CACAO, and/or MAYA. Maya Protocol commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Rules program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact). \n\n__KYC Requirements:__\n\nMaya Protocol __does not__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues:__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nAny vulnerability, bug, or security issue related to THORChain, Cosmos-sdk, or Cometbft/Tendermint is ineligible for submission to us if it:\n\n1. Has been previously discovered or reported through any channel, including but not limited to:\n- Direct reports to Nine Realms\n- THORChain's Immunefi bug bounty program\n- Other bug bounty platforms or programs\n- Public or private GitHub issues\n- Discord/Telegram discussions\n- Social media posts or discussions\n- Security forums or mailing lists\n- Academic papers or research\n- Block explorers or chain analysis\n- THORChain node logs or monitoring systems\n\n2. Exists in:\n- Any THORChain codebase (current or historical)\n- THORChain documentation\n- THORChain smart contracts\n- THORChain nodes or infrastructure\n- Any THORChain-related tools or interfaces\n\n3. Has been:\n- Fixed in any version\n- Acknowledged by the THORChain team\n- Discussed in any public or private forum\n- Known to any THORChain contributors or developers\n- In other words: If it's related to THORChain in any way, it's out of scope for our program - regardless of how or where the bug was found, reported, or \n  documented.\n\n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n- [https://docs.mayaprotocol.com/audits](https://docs.mayaprotocol.com/audits)",
