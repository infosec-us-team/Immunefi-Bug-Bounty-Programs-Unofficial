      "programOverview": "SpookySwap is an automated market-making (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) for the Fantom Opera network. Different from other DEXs, we're invested in building a strong foundation with our BOO token as a governance token, diverse farms, a built in bridge, built in limit orders and user-centered service. \nFor more information about SpookySwap, please visit [https://spooky.fi/](https://spooky.fi/)\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nCritical severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.  In addition, Critical and High severity bug reports will require a suggestion on how to fix the vulnerability for a reward\n\nCritical smart contract bug reports will be rewarded with USD 200, 000 only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than USD 35, 000\n\nSpookySwap is aware of a bug where a pool can get added automatically even without doing add, if the pool is added on the corresponding farm contract, and someone deposits.  This is under The Rewarder:\n  - [https://ftmscan.com/address/0xddb816c59200af55b1ca20735ef086626a2c6a8d](https://ftmscan.com/address/0xddb816c59200af55b1ca20735ef086626a2c6a8d)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __SpookySwap__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in a mix of __USDC, ETH, BOO, and FTM__, at the discretion of the team \n\nAll smart contracts of SpookySwap can be found at [https://github.com/SpookySwap](https://github.com/SpookySwap). However, only those in the Assets in Scope table are considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nIf an impact can be caused to any other asset managed by SpookSwap that isnâ€™t on this table but for which the impact is in the Impacts in Scope section below, you are encouraged to submit it for the consideration by the project. \n",
