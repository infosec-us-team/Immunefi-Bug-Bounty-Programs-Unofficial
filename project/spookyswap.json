      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nCritical severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.  In addition, Critical and High severity bug reports will require a suggestion on how to fix the vulnerability for a reward\n\nCritical smart contract bug reports will be rewarded with USD 200, 000 only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than USD 35, 000\n\nSpookySwap is aware of a bug where a pool can get added automatically even without doing add, if the pool is added on the corresponding farm contract, and someone deposits.  This is under The Rewarder:\n  - [https://ftmscan.com/address/0xddb816c59200af55b1ca20735ef086626a2c6a8d](https://ftmscan.com/address/0xddb816c59200af55b1ca20735ef086626a2c6a8d)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __SpookySwap__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in a mix of __USDC, ETH, BOO, and FTM__, at the discretion of the team \n\nAll smart contracts of SpookySwap can be found at [https://github.com/SpookySwap](https://github.com/SpookySwap). However, only those in the Assets in Scope table are considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nIf an impact can be caused to any other asset managed by SpookSwap that isnâ€™t on this table but for which the impact is in the Impacts in Scope section below, you are encouraged to submit it for the consideration by the project. \n",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
