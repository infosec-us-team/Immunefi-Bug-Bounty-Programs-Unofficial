However, a minimum reward of USD 10000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)\n[10 000 USD] \n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork)\n[10 000 USD] \n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk, which includes all affected projects on top of the respective blockchain/DLT, and the market cap according to the average between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com, calculated at the time the bug report is submitted. \n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 50000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 15000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n\nFor critical web/apps bugs, reports will be rewarded with 15000, only if the impact leads to:\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of 10000.  \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward.\n\nThe amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at 100% and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every [300 blocks] the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down.\n\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor high Blockchain/DLT non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Unintended chain split (network partition)\n[5 000 USD] \n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments\n[5 000 USD] \n- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters\n[5 000 USD]\n- RPC API crash affecting projects with greater than or equal to 25% of the market capitalization on top of the respective layer\n[5 000 USD]\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of 2000 to 15000 with the reward calculated based on 100% of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward. \n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward.",
