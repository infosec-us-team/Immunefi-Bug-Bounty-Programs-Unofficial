With deep experience in the crypto space, our passionate and committed team of blockchain experts, solution architects, product managers, and developers are accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology by focusing on the critical components of security, confidentiality, speed, and innovation.\nWith unprecedented successes—including the ApeCoin launch—Horizen delivers value at scale. From crypto-native organizations seeking new monetization paths to companies transitioning to Web3, we deliver overwhelming value for both our partners and the entire crypto industry.\n\nFor more information about Horizen, please visit [https://horizen.io/ ](https://horizenlabs.io/)\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)",

However, payouts can be done in ZEN. Horizen Labs commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nUnlike other bug bounty programs on Immunefi, all bug report submissions, including associated vulnerabilities, become the exclusive property of Horizen. By making a submission to this program and in consideration for a bounty, the bug submitter conveys all ownership rights, titles, and interests in the bug report to Horizen. Thus, the final decision on whether a postmortem will be written is at the sole discretion of Horizen\n\n__KYC Requirements:__ \n\nHorizen Labs __does__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n__KYC Info Required:__\n\nName, address,  ID/passport, and a proof of residency\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.",

Even though the domain may be the same, different ports may point to different assets.  \n\n__Dev Environment and Documentation__\n\nHorizen Labs has included dev documentation and/or instructions to help in reviewing code and exploring for bugs:\n- [https://eon.horizen.io/docs/](https://eon.horizen.io/docs/)\n- [https://faucet.horizen.io/](https://faucet.horizen.io/)\n- [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph)\n- [https://www.horizen.io/wallets/spherebyhorizen/](https://www.horizen.io/wallets/spherebyhorizen/)\n- [https://gobi-explorer.horizen.io/](https://gobi-explorer.horizen.io/)\n- [https://eon.horizen.io/docs/](https://eon.horizen.io/docs/)\n- https://eon.horizen.io/status/gobi\n\n__Impacts to other assets__\n\nHackers are encouraged to submit issues outside of the outlined Impacts and Assets in Scope. \n\nIf whitehats can demonstrate a critical impact on code in production for an asset not in scope, Horizen Labs encourages you to submit your bug report using the “primacy of impact exception” asset. \n\n__Impacts in Scope__\n\n(For Blockchain/DLTR and Smart Contracts Only) This program is considered to be governed by Primacy of Impact.
