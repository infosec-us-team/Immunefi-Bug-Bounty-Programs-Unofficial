  "programOverview": "__Jito-Solana__\n\nJito-Solana is standing on the shoulders of giants — Solana Labs. \n\nWe’ve modified the Solana Labs validator client to allow validators to efficiently collect and distribute MEV to their stakers. \n\nThe validator client supports lists of transactions (bundles) which gives searchers and high frequency traders the flexibility in expressing transaction ordering. It tightly integrates with the relayer and third party  block engines to improve the network performance for all.\n\nSetting it up is as simple as downloading our validator client and passing the closest Block Engine URL on the command line.\n\n__Relayer__\n\nThe relayer provides a layer of protection between your validator’s transaction processing unit and spam from the network. The relayer works seamlessly with QUIC and allows one to separate receiving and verification of packets from the transaction processing inside your validator. \n\nRun your own or use our hosted version.\n\n__Tip Payment & Distribution__\n\nThe tip payment and distribution smart contracts are responsible for enabling and distributing validator tips.\n\n__Re-Staking / Vault__\n\nJito (Re)staking is a multi-asset staking protocol for node consensus networks. The system is made of two programs: the restaking program and the vault program.\n\nThe restaking program acts as a node consensus network and operator registry. The program leverages a flexible system of admins so NCNs can customize the operators and vaults supported and operators can customize the NCNs they stake to and vaults they can receive delegations from.\n\nThe vault program manages the minting and burning of vault receipt tokens (VRTs). VRTs are SPL tokens that represent a pro-rata stake of assets in the vault. VRTs provide enhanced liquidity, composability, and interoperability with other Solana programs. The program also leverages a flexible system of admins so vaults can customize the capacity, operators that can receive delegations from the vault, the NCNs supported by the vault, and the fee structure for staking and unstaking.\n\n__Interceptor__\n\nInterceptor is a program designed to help SPL Stake Pool LSTs avoid the impacts of toxic decentralized exchange flow resulting from socialized liquidity. \n\nFor more information about Jito Foundation, please visit [https://www.jito.network/](https://www.jito.network/).\n\nJito provides rewards in JTO on Solana, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the __Rewards by Threat Level__ section further below.\n\n__Known Issue Guidelines__\n\nTo ensure fairness and transparency in the bug reporting process, Jito is prohibited from claiming that a bug report is a known or duplicate issue without providing clear and verifiable evidence. This measure is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the bug bounty program. Jito must present specific proof that an issue has been previously reported and acknowledged even if not disclosed publicly or privately as a known issue. Without such evidence, the bug report will be considered valid and eligible for the appropriate reward as per the bug bounty program terms. For detailed information as what qualifies as acceptable proof of known issues, refer to the article on Immunefi Support: [Report Closed for Known Issues](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10644746170897-Report-Closed-for-Known-Issues).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nJito Foundation’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://jito-foundation.gitbook.io/mev/resources/audits](https://jito-foundation.gitbook.io/mev/resources/audits). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Jito has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",

  "rewardsBody": "__Rewards by Threat Level__\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward $250,000. However, a minimum reward of USD $100,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor __Critical Blockchain/DLT__ bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown) - $250,000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork) - $250,000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork) - $250,000\n\nFor __High Blockchain/DLT__ non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n- Unintended chain split (network partition) - $100,000\n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments - $100,000\n\nFor __Critical Blockchain/DLT__ bugs, the reward is dependent on the ratio between the funds at risk, which includes all affected projects on top of the respective Blockchain/DLT, and the market cap according to the 7-day TWAP of JTO, calculated at the time the bug report is submitted. \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Jito Foundation directly and reward amounts are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in JTO on Solana.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the 7-day [TWAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted_average_price) of JTO at the time of settlement.
