      "programOverview": "Lombard is on a mission to unlock Bitcoin's potential as a dynamic financial tool by connecting it to DeFi with LBTC. LBTC is a secure Bitcoin LST, developed by Lombard on top of Babylon. It's a yield-bearing, natively cross-chain, liquid Bitcoin backed 1:1 by BTC. With LBTC, Bitcoin can be held as a store of value and simultaneously used to lend, borrow, stake, trade, and transfer in DeFi across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\n\nFounded in April 2024, Lombard is dedicated to unlocking Bitcoin's potential as a dynamic financial tool by connecting it to DeFi. Lombard is building the universal standard for Bitcoin. Secured by Bitcoin-aligned ecosystem players, Lombard enables the yield-bearing BTC to move cross-chain without fragmenting liquidity, paving the way to become the single largest catalyst for onboarding net new capital into DeFi.\n\nBitcoin represents over 50% of the cryptocurrency market. But its interoperability with DeFi has been limited to date.\n\nOur flagship product, LBTC—a yield-bearing, cross-chain, liquid Bitcoin backed 1:1 by BTC— changes this and brings DeFi interoperability to ‘digital gold’. For the first time Bitcoin can be held as a store of value, and simultaneously used to earn, stake, trade, and transfer in DeFi at scale. Jump to LBTC.\n\nLBTC opens up new opportunities for Bitcoin holders to earn, stake, and trade on-chain, all while retaining Bitcoin as a store of value. For DeFi protocols, LBTC provides increased liquidity and user activity by unlocking $1.4 trillion new capital.\n\nLombard is currently live on Ethereum mainnet in Public Beta, where eligible participants are staking native BTC and minting LBTC.\n\nFor more information about Lombard, please visit https://www.lombard.finance/\n\nFinal Commit report link [here](https://github.com/lombard-finance/evm-smart-contracts/commit/edd557006050ee5b847fa1cc67c1c4e19079437e)\n\nThis Audit Competition is running on mainnet. The following conditions apply:\n\n1. Lombard team will freeze the codebase during the duration of the Audit Competition\n2. Duplicates are rewarded\n\n**KYC Requirement**\n\n__Lombard will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required__\n\n- Full name\n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID",

For the full details read our [Lombard Audit Competition Reward Terms](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/31051806316433-Lombard-Audit-Competition-Reward-Terms)\n\nRewards are distributed all at once after the competition has ended. No rewards are distributed during the competition.\n\nThe reward pool size is determined by the greatest condition met. If multiple conditions are met only the largest reward pool applies. \n\n- If one or more Critical severity bugs are found, the reward pool will be - **$100,000 USD**\n- If one or more High severity bugs are found, the reward pool will be - **$75,000 USD**\n- If one or more Medium severity bugs are found, the reward pool will be - **$35,000 USD**\n- Othewise the reward pool will be - **$20,000 USD**\n\nDuplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward.\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/).\n\n__Insight Rewards Payment Terms__\n\n*Insight Rewards*: Portion of the Rewards Pool\n\n*The \"Insight\" severity was introduced on Boost (Audit Competitions) & Attackathon programs to recognize contributions that extend beyond identifying immediate vulnerabilities. Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report. However, our team or program will designate it accordingly if applicable. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment and will always be rewarded. [View more information about Insights](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/13333032674961-Severity-Classification-System?utm_source=immunefi)\n\nDuplicates of Insight reports are not eligible for a reward.",

      "assetsBodyV2": "__Asset Accuracy Assurance__\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nLombard’s completed audit reports can be found [here](https://github.com/lombard-finance/evm-smart-contracts/tree/main/docs/audit). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Private Known Issues Reward Policy__\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward equal to that of a bug one severity lower.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nLombard adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this audit competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Lombard has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

Which are not?__\n\nERC-20, ERC-20 Permit\n\n__What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?__\n\nIf the Ethereum mainnet contract is Paused or upgraded from the audit competition version.\n\n__What monitoring systems may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?__\n\nWe use https://www.hexagate.com/ for contracts monitoring.\n\n__What addresses are considered out of scope for bug reports requiring their involvement, regardless of whether they operate within or exceed their attributed privileges?__\n\nAll admin and operational roles are out of scope\n\n__Which chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?__\n\nEthereum, Base, BSC\n\n__Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\nIt's an upgrade and extension of the contracts deployed here:\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4cbd8802465f690e7637454783955fa8e6d0c4bc#code\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x67927d7ea19f9a1053f4f5bbdf827ed9870f1a1b#code\nThe main difference is upgraded and extended logic(for example TSS was replaced with multisig), and also new contracts which provide new functionality to the Lombard stack(like integration with Chaiblink bridge and Layerzero, previous contract also had bridge functions but it never was used and was moved to separate contract). Also, there is new logic and a new contract for improved user experience (mintWithFee)\n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs?__\nWe are most concerned about stealing or loss of funds. We would most like security researchers to break our 1:1 peg with bitcoin by contract exploits, and to focus on how to steal funds from another user through the contracts provided. We are most concerned about re-entrancy attacks and malicious payload injections as attack vectors. Different ways that allow double claiming of deposits.\n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\nWe rely on OpenZeppelin contracts for a lot of boilerplate Solidity code (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts and https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable). On top of this, we depend on Chainlink and LayerZero code for bridging (https://github.com/Cyfrin/ccip-contracts and https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/tree/main/packages/layerzero-v2/evm).\n\n__Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?__\nAll admin/operator functions are out of scope, and all notarization systems(lombard/chainlink/LayerZero) are out of scope. For upgradable contracts, all bugs that can be fixed by upgrade and do not bring financial damage are counted as low severity.\n\n__Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?__\nWe use complex bridging code and extend base functionality for given contracts in this regard, which takes a bit of back and forth reading to understand. In this case, specifically, there will be some logic that will be activated given a setting about enabling attestations; in a mainnet scenario, we should always assume that attestations are enabled. We have a complex notarization system with different validators, so there is no centralization.",

With LBTC, Bitcoin can be held as a store of value and simultaneously used to lend, borrow, stake, trade, and transfer in DeFi across multiple blockchain ecosystems\n",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
