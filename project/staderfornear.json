This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nPrevious issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope of this program: \n  - [Halborn Audit Report](https://staderlabs.com/docs/near/StaderLabs%20NearX%20Staking%20Smart%20Contract%20Final%20Reaudit%20by%20Halborn.pdf)\n  - [Blocksec Audit Report](https://staderlabs.com/docs/near/StaderLabs%20NEARx%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20Report%20by%20BlockSec.pdf)\n  - [Osec Audit Report](https://staderlabs.com/docs/near/StaderLabs%20NearX%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20Report%20by%20OSEC.pdf)\n\nVulnerabilities reported to any Stader program are considered as reported to all Stader Bug Bounty programs. Reports of the same vulnerability to multiple Stader Bug Bounty programs will be considered as a single report when the reward is calculated.\n\nPayouts are handled by the Stader team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in USDC or ETH, at the discretion of the team.",
