For bug reports for their Smart Contracts, please visit their other program:\n - Kiln DeFi: https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/kiln-defi/information/\n - Kiln On-Chain V1: https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/kiln-on-chain-v1/information/#top\n - Kiln On-Chain V2: https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/kiln/information/\n\n\nFor more information about Kiln Infrastructure + Web, please visit [https://www.kiln.fi/](https://www.kiln.fi/). \n\nKiln Infrastructure + Web provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__KYC Requirement __\n\nKiln Infrastructure + Web will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\nIf the claim comes from an individual:\n - The first names, surnames, date and place of birth of the person concerned\n - A Valid ID\n\nIf the claim comes from a business:\n - Legal form, name, registration number and address of the registered office\n - Valid certificate of incorporation\n - List of shareholders/directors\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nKiln Infrastructure + Web adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page.\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.",

The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.\n\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Kiln Infrastructure + Web team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted.

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
