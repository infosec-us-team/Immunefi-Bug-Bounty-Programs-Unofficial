  "programOverview": "monero-oxide is a collection of Rust libraries to work with the Monero protocol, including its zero-knowledge proofs. monero-oxide hosts a monero-wallet, a memory-safe library to build and sign Monero transactions, including an implementation of the FROSTLASS threshold signing protocol. monero-oxide is used by Serai (https://serai.exchange) and Cuprate (https://cuprate.org). For bugs affecting Serai, which hosts its own bug bounty program on Immunefi (https://immunefi.com/bounty/serai), both programs should be submitted to yet only one will issue a reward (of the submitter’s choice).\nFor more information about monero-oxide, please visit https://github.com/monero-oxide/monero-oxide\nmonero-oxide provides rewards in [XMR] on [Monero], denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n- Be a member of the monero-oxide, Cuprate, or Serai organizations\n- Have written code required for the submission to be eligible\n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nmonero-oxide adheres to **category 3 - Approval Required**. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nmonero-oxide adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Blockchain/DLT - Critical\n- Blockchain/DLT - High\n- Blockchain/DLT - Medium\n- Blockchain/DLT - Low\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- https://github.com/monero-oxide/monero-oxide/issues\n- https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/issues\n- https://github.com/serai-dex/serai/issues\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nmonero-oxide’s completed audit reports can be found at https://github.com/monero-oxide/monero-oxide/tree/main/audits. Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward without demonstrated remaining impact.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is 100,000 USD. For high Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is 10,000 USD. For medium Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is 5,000 USD. For low Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward is 1,000 USD.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by Power Up Privacy directly and are denominated in **USD**. However, payments are done in **XMR** on **Monero**\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted.

  "impactsBody": "monero-oxide does not attempt to implement all Monero consensus rules, instead deferring that to works such as Cuprate, a Monero node written in Rust. Instead, monero-oxide aims to support working with transactions as useful to enable building programs from nodes to wallets with. monero-oxide does include some consensus rules however, whether to provide certain functionality or to maintain certain invariants. Our impact, \"Incompatibilities with the targeted Monero consensus protocol which would require reimplementing notable sections of monero-oxide\", is intended for when we do not simply omit a consensus rule, yet actively conflict with it, requiring the caller to avoid monero-oxide's code and handle the issue themselves. Implementing features, such as the addition of specific consensus rules, will not be considered re-implementation.\n\nRoughly stated, the academic definition of incorrect is an algorithm whose honest execution will not have the expected result. The roughly-stated academic definition of incomplete is an algorithm which claims to work with a set of cases yet actually only works for a subset. This is distinct from unsoundness, where a verifier should be convinced a correct proof is correct yet is convinced by an incorrect proof, and zero-knowledge, where an algorithm which shouldn't reveal any additional information about the secrets does in fact do so. Our occassional (as appropriate within the Monero protocol) support for points which have a term from a small-order subgroup will not inherently be considered incorrect or incomplete unless such effects actually descend from this property.\n\nFor the \"Undocumented panic reachable from a public API\" impact, we are officially considering Rust panics. We cannot prevent an operating system which decides to terminate a program using our library. We will, however, consider out-of-memory issues (and similar) if they're reasonably posited as a Denial of Service. The fact any function allocates, and therefore can exceed the program's allowed memory usage, will not automatically be considered as a valid submission. Notable overhead for the amount of memory allocated as a factor of the amount of memory legitimately present must be demonstrated.\n\nFor documentation-related impacts (e.g. \"Undocumented ...\"), updates to documentation will be considered bug fixes as expected. For non-documentation-related impacts, updates to documentation alone will not be considered bug fixes.\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed with `debug-assertions = false`, `overflow-checks = true`, and `panic = \"abort\"`.",
