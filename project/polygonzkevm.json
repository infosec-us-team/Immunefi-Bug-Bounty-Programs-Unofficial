      "programOverview": "Polygon zkEVM is the leading zero-knowledge scaling solution that is fully equivalent to an EVM. All existing smart contracts, developer toolings and wallets work seamlessly. Polygon zkEVM harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs in order to help reduce transaction costs and massively increase throughput, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum.\n\nBuilding dApps on Polygon zkEVM is similar to Ethereum. Simply switch to the Polygon zkEVM RPC and start building on a network with much higher throughput and lower fees. Polygon zkEVM provides a complete EVM-like experience for developers and users alike. \n\nFor more information about Polygon Labs and Polygon protocols, please visit [https://polygon.technology/](https://polygon.technology/). \n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the Immunefi [Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table. Polygon Labs has sole discretion to determine whether a bug is in scope, the level of the bug, and the ultimate bounty amount.",
      "rewardsBody": "Please review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). This is a simplified 4-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nPayouts over the lower bound reward are directly related to the direct funds at risk. If no funds are at risk, the Critical or High payouts are limited to the minimum, unless decided otherwise by Polygon Labs.\n\nFor the purposes of clarification, funds at risk refer to the proof of loss of funds.\n\nRewards for critical blockchain/DLT and smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 50 000.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__ \nPayouts are handled by the Polygon Labs team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in USDC or MATIC at the Polygon Labs teams' discretion. Polygon Labs commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nThis bug bounty program is only open to individuals who reside outside of the countries that are restricted by OFAC and by UNSC resolutions. If the individual is a US person, tax information may be required in order to properly issue a 1099.\n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program.\n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements__ \nPolygon Labs does have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n| KYC Info Required    |\n| ---------- |\n| Wallet Address    |\n| Passport (for Critical payouts)    |\n| Place of residence (for Critical payouts)    |\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report which Polygon Labs determines in its sole discretion.  \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nPolygon zkEVM adheres to __category 3__. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.",

Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: 1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and 2) zero payout. \n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited: \n  - Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n  - Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n  - Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n  - Any denial of service attacks\n  - Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n  - Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n  - [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules](https://immunefi.com/rules/).
