  "programOverview": "Exodus Movement, Inc., founded in 2015, develops the Exodus Wallet, a beautifully designed, non-custodial multi-asset software wallet available on desktop, mobile, and browser platforms that supports over 100,000 asset pairs while keeping users’ private keys encrypted and stored locally on their own devices.\n\nFor more information about Exodus, please visit [https://www.exodus.com/](https://www.exodus.com/).\n\nExodus provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nExodus will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- A contracted technical contributor who is being directly compensated by the project or directly compensated by a contracted organization providing technical services to the project\n- A former contracted technical contributor who, for the past year from the date of the bug report submission, was directly compensated by the project or was compensated by a contracted organization to the project. In the case of the latter, the status of the organization’s contract with the project is irrelevant.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nExodus adheres to **Category 2: Notice Required** . This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nExodus adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Website & Application  —  Critical\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- In-App web3 browser findings except sandbox bypassing affecting wallets directly.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical web/apps bugs, reports will be rewarded with Max Critical only if the impact leads to:\n\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of minimum reward as per the table below. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table and according to the rewards table below per the asset that was impacted.  \n\nEach of the assets have their own specific rewards which will be used instead of the reward table.\nHere is the information formatted as a clean Markdown table:\n\n| Asset                  | Low    | Medium | High   | Critical          |\n| ---------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----------------- |\n| Passkey Wallet         | $1,500 | $3,750 | $7,500 | $12,000 – $18,000 |\n| `*.exodus.io`          | $300   | $1,125 | $3,750 | $7,500 – $10,000  |\n| `*.exodus.com`         | $300   | $1,125 | $3,750 | $7,500 – $10,000  |\n| Exodus Desktop Wallet  | $300   | $1,125 | $3,750 | $7,500 – $10,000  |\n| `exodusmovement.ex...` | $300   | $1,125 | $3,750 | $7,500 – $10,000  |\n| `*.a.exodus.io`        | $500   | $2,250 | $6,250 | $10,000 – $15,000 |\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Exodus team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
