Easily connect to Ethereum, Polygon, xDai, Binance Smart Chain, and more.\n\nFor more information about Pillar, please visit [https://www.pillar.fi/](https://www.pillar.fi/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft.\n  - Ability to mint membership NFTs without the corresponding stake of Pillar tokens.\n  - Withdrawing more funds than what is staked.\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 1 day.\n  - Withdrawing of funds before the completion of staking term.",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Pillar__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ (on Polygon).",
