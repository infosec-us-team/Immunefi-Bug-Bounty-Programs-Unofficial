Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the Immunefi [Bug Report Template and Best Practices.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)",

However, payouts are done in RUBIC. Rubic commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\n__KYC Requirements__\n\nRubic does not have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\n__Previous audits and known issues can be found at:__\n\n- Audit report - [https://github.com/mixbytes/audits_public/tree/master/Rubic ](https://github.com/mixbytes/audits_public/tree/master/Rubic)",

Any impact that applies to assets not in active use, like test or mock files, are out-of-scope of the bug bounty program unless explicitly mentioned as in-scope. \n\n__Smart Contracts__ \n\n- __Smart Contracts - PoC__, Smart Contract bug reports are required to include a runnable Proof of Concept (PoC) in order to prove impact.  \n- For more information on PoCs please visit: [Proof of Concept (PoC) Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\nWhitehats are highly encouraged to review any potential subdomains and what specific port(s) are in scope.
