      "programOverview": "DODO is a decentralized exchange platform powered by the Proactive Market Maker (PMM) algorithm. It features highly capital-efficient liquidity pools that support single-token provision, reduce impermanent loss, and minimize slippage for traders. The trading platform also offers SmartTrade, a decentralized liquidity aggregation service that routes to and compares various liquidity sources to quote the optimal prices between any two tokens. In addition, DODO removed all roadblocks hindering liquidity pool creation for the issuance of new assets - asset ratios, liquidity depths, fee rates, and other parameters can all be freely customized and configured in real-time. Based on this breakthrough, DODO has developed Crowdpooling, a permissionless, equal opportunity liquidity offering mechanic, as well as customizable technical solutions geared towards professional on-chain market makers.\n\nMore information about DODO can be found on their website, [https://dodoex.io/](https://dodoex.io/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the prevention of the loss of user funds.

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards for Smart Contract vulnerabilities are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nThe calculation of the final reward amounts will be based on the economic impact of the discovered vulnerabilities, as well as the level of difficulty in discovering these vulnerabilities. As for the economic impact, this is capped at 10% of economic damage, which accounts for direct funds at risk as well as other aspects at the discretion of the DODO team. \n\nTo qualify for a reward, please include as much information about the vulnerability as possible in your report, including:\n\n  - The conditions on which reproducing the bug is contingent\n  - The steps needed to reproduce the bug or, preferably, a proof of concept\n  - The potential implications of the vulnerability being abused\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nDODO adheres to __category 3__. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our Responsible Publication page.\n\nPayouts up to __USD 100 000__ are handled by the __DODO__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __DODO__.",
