      "programOverview": "The SORA community envisions a new economic world order — one that is truly decentralized and democratic. SORA is building to deliver financial inclusion for all without discrimination and provide a better method to manage day-to-day finances.\n\nSORA is both a supranational world economic system that decentralizes the concept of a central bank as well as a network in the Polkadot ecosystem that will connect to the Polkadot relay chain and the parachains with built-in tools focused on DeFi.\n\nThe SORA network excels at providing tools for decentralized applications that use digital assets, such as atomic token swaps, bridging tokens to other blockchains, and creating programmatic rules involving digital assets. Besides Polkaswap, one of the main applications running on the SORA network is the SORA decentralized economic system itself.\n\nFor more information about Sora, please visit [https://sora.org](https://sora.org)",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate classifications for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a Proof of Concept (PoC) with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __SORA__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payouts are done in __TBCD__ and can be vested with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.",
