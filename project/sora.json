SORA is building to deliver financial inclusion for all without discrimination and provide a better method to manage day-to-day finances.\n\nSORA is both a supranational world economic system that decentralizes the concept of a central bank as well as a network in the Polkadot ecosystem that will connect to the Polkadot relay chain and the parachains with built-in tools focused on DeFi.\n\nThe SORA network excels at providing tools for decentralized applications that use digital assets, such as atomic token swaps, bridging tokens to other blockchains, and creating programmatic rules involving digital assets. Besides Polkaswap, one of the main applications running on the SORA network is the SORA decentralized economic system itself.\n\nFor more information about Sora, please visit [https://sora.org](https://sora.org)",
