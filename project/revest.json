Discover the mechanics, governance, and monetization of this protocol with targeted use-cases.\n\nFor more information about Revest, please visit [https://revest.finance/](https://revest.finance/).",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll Critical/High severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, Critical bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nThe following known issues are considered to be out of scope of this program: \n  - All previously highlighted issues in the audit report here: [https://solidity.finance/audits/Revest/](https://solidity.finance/audits/Revest/)\n  - A reentrancy vulnerability in FNFTHandler, where the active contract is currently being replaced (However, any new variations of attacks that can be executed on the new active contract would still be considered as in scope). \n  - A known vulnerability in TokenVault within the “handleMultipleDeposits” method. This is understood, documented, and will never be called by live code.\n  - Any bugs relating to vulnerabilities in their oracles and the UniswapV3 oracle full coverage problem (Impacted oracles are currently disabled from their UI). Vulnerability is understood to never lead to theft-of-value, only early-unlocks.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 30 000__ only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than __USD 10 000__.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Revest__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.",
