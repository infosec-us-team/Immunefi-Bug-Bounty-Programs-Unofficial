For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nArkham adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n\n- Web/App - Critical\n- Web/App - High\n- Web/App - Medium\n\nArkham adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Web/App - Low - Temporarily disabling user to access target site\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nArkham has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices.",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Web/App bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 25 000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- Old referral links exposing user emails\n- User can share their private entities and dashboards by sharing the URL (this is a feature not a bug)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nArkham has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/arkham-intelligence/751c39ed-1bff-4047-9082-24df856ab24e/index.html](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/arkham-intelligence/751c39ed-1bff-4047-9082-24df856ab24e/index.html)\n- [https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/arkham-intel-exchange-bounty-contract/f86ecee0-d44f-48c3-80e9-e8570e2abadb/index.html](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/arkham-intel-exchange-bounty-contract/f86ecee0-d44f-48c3-80e9-e8570e2abadb/index.html)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n\n- Web/App - Critical\n- Web/App - High\n- Web/App - Medium\n- Web/App - Low\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Arkham__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in ARKM. \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.",
