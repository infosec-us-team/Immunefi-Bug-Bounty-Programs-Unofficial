It allows users to algorithmically optimize their digital asset allocation across leading DeFi protocols, whether they want to maximize it or keep tabs on their risk-return profile\n\nCurrently, Idle DAO product suite includes: \n\n - **Best-Yield**: this strategy combines multiple money markets to automatically provide the highest interest rates, beating the best traditional offerings across interest-bearing tokens and DeFi protocols.\n\n - **Yield Tranches**: this product allows users to deposit assets in a Defi protocol with two risk-adjusted investment profiles (Senior and Junior) with different risks/rewards ratio\n\n\n**The bug bounty program is focused around the Idle protocol Best Yield V4 and Yield Tranches smart contracts and the prevention of loss of user funds.**",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nThe final reward for critical bounty payouts is capped at 10% of the funds at risk based on the vulnerability reported.\n\nPoC is required for all levels.\n\nTheft of yield or interest is considered as Medium but may be considered High depending on the amount of funds at risk.\n\nBest practices critiques are not accepted under this program. \n\nThe likelihood of exploitability is also taken into consideration in the\ndetermination of the final payout amount based on the severity of the bug\nreported according to the table below:\n\n| | Medium | High | Critical |\n|  :-- | :-- | :-- | :-: |\n| Almost Certain | $5,000 | $20,000 | $50,000 |\n| Likely | $3,000 | $10,000 | $25,000 | \n| Possible | $1,000 | $5,000 | $10,000 |\n| Unlikely  | $500 | $1,000 | $5,000 |\n| Almost Possible | $100 | $500 | $1,000 |\n\nPayouts are handled by **Idle Finance** governance directly and are denominated\nin **USD**. Payouts under $10,000 are done in **USDC**. When payouts are over\n$10,000, the first $10,000 is paid in **USDC** and then the rest are paid in\n**IDLE** up to the total of $50 000.",
