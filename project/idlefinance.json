      "programOverview": "Idle is a decentralized protocol dedicated to bringing automatic asset\nallocation and aggregation to the interest-bearing tokens economy. This\nprotocol bundles stable crypto-assets (stablecoins) into tokenized baskets that\nare programmed to automatically rebalance based on different management logics.\n\nThe Idle Protocol employs a strategy-token system. Every allocation strategy\nhas its own set of tokens that represent a pool of yield-generating assets\nspread across different DeFi protocols. These tokens represent the investorâ€™s\nproportional ownership of the whole pool and the interest accrued over\ntime. This issuing method is similar to traditional mutual funds shares\nstructure, and it allows Idle to be non-custodial.\n\nCurrently, Idle uses this allocation strategy:\n\n- **Best-Yield**: this strategy combines multiple money markets to\nautomatically provide the highest interest rates, beating the best traditional\nofferings across interest-bearing tokens and DeFi protocols.\n\nConsequently, users can hold IdleTokens related to a specific strategy and a\nspecific stablecoin.\n\nIdle aims to unlock the power of decentralized finance for everyone by a single\nvehicle that automatically rebalances between underlying providers to always\nmaintain the highest rates or the optimal risk/return allocation.\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around the Idle protocol V4 smart contracts and the prevention of loss of user funds.

      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the\nfollowing types:\n\n**Smart Contracts/Blockchain:**\n\n- Re-entrancy\n- Logic errors\n  - including user authentication errors\n- Solidity/EVM details not considered\n  - including integer over-/under-flow\n  - including unhandled exceptions\n- Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n  - including composability vulnerabilities\n- Oracle failure/manipulation\n- Novel governance attacks\n- Economic/financial attacks\n  - including flash loan attacks\n- Congestion and scalability\n  - including running out of gas\n  - including block stuffing\n  - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n- Consensus failures\n- Cryptography problems\n  - Signature malleability\n  - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n  - Weak randomness\n  - Weak encryption\n- Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n- Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System 2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nThe final reward for critical bounty payouts is capped at 10% of the funds at risk based on the vulnerability reported.\n\nPoC is required for all levels.\n\nTheft of yield or interest is considered as Medium but may be considered High depending on the amount of funds at risk.\n\nBest practices critiques are not accepted under this program. \n\nThe likelihood of exploitability is also taken into consideration in the\ndetermination of the final payout amount based on the severity of the bug\nreported according to the table below:\n\n| | Medium | High | Critical |\n|  :-- | :-- | :-- | :-: |\n| Almost Certain | $5,000 | $20,000 | $50,000 |\n| Likely | $3,000 | $10,000 | $25,000 | \n| Possible | $1,000 | $5,000 | $10,000 |\n| Unlikely  | $500 | $1,000 | $5,000 |\n| Almost Possible | $100 | $500 | $1,000 |\n\nPayouts are handled by **Idle Finance** governance directly and are denominated\nin **USD**. Payouts under $10,000 are done in **USDC**. When payouts are over\n$10,000, the first $10,000 is paid in **USDC** and then the rest are paid in\n**IDLE** up to the total of $50 000.",
