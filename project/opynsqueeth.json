      "programOverview": "Opyn builds DeFi native derivatives and options infrastructure that allow users and protocols to buy, sell, and create options, and utilize brand new primitives like squeeth. DeFi enthusiasts and projects alike rely on Opyn’s smart contracts and interface to hedge themselves against DeFi risks and take positions on different cryptocurrencies.\n\nSqueeth (squared ETH) is a new financial derivative. Squeeth is the first [Power Perpetual](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/power-perpetuals/) and gives traders perpetual exposure to ETH².\n\nMechanism-wise, Squeeth functions similar to a [perpetual swap](https://firefly.exchange/blog/primer-on-perpetual-swaps), tracking the index of ETH² rather than ETH. It provides global options-like exposure (pure [convexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp), pure [gamma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp)) without the need for either strikes or expiries, effectively consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single ERC20 token.\n\nIn short, Squeeth makes options perpetual and is a very effective hedge for Uniswap LPs, all ETH/USD options, and anything that has a curved payoff.\n\nFor more information about Opyn, please visit [https://www.opyn.co/](https://www.opyn.co/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield",

All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts/Blockchain__\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for any amount of time \n  - Smart contract gas drainage\n\n__Web/App__\n\n  - Any exploit that can cause direct and unequivocal loss or permanent locking of user funds",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Critical and High severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 25 000__ for Critical bug reports.\n\nThe following impacts are considered to be out-of-scope of this bug bounty program:\n  - Economic TWAP manipulation \n  - System insolvency if due to economic factors / market movements\n\nIf your attack requires orders of magnitude more funds than profits, you can submit but we'll evaluate on a case-by-case basis.\n\nCritical payouts by Sherlock will only be paid out for critical bugs that would result in a loss of funds and can be executed profitably, and this then excludes Sherlock critical bounty payout for temporary freezing bugs.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Opyn__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USD__, __USDC__, __DAI__ or __ETH__. Critical severity smart contract rewards will be paid out by Sherlock with their bug bounty matching program and are done in __USDC__.",
