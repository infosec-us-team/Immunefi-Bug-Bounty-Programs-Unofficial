DeFi enthusiasts and projects alike rely on Opyn’s smart contracts and interface to hedge themselves against DeFi risks and take positions on different cryptocurrencies.\n\nSqueeth (squared ETH) is a new financial derivative. Squeeth is the first [Power Perpetual](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/power-perpetuals/) and gives traders perpetual exposure to ETH².\n\nMechanism-wise, Squeeth functions similar to a [perpetual swap](https://firefly.exchange/blog/primer-on-perpetual-swaps), tracking the index of ETH² rather than ETH. It provides global options-like exposure (pure [convexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp), pure [gamma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp)) without the need for either strikes or expiries, effectively consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single ERC20 token.\n\nIn short, Squeeth makes options perpetual and is a very effective hedge for Uniswap LPs, all ETH/USD options, and anything that has a curved payoff.\n\nFor more information about Opyn, please visit [https://www.opyn.co/](https://www.opyn.co/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Critical and High severity smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 25 000__ for Critical bug reports.\n\nThe following impacts are considered to be out-of-scope of this bug bounty program:\n  - Economic TWAP manipulation \n  - System insolvency if due to economic factors / market movements\n\nIf your attack requires orders of magnitude more funds than profits, you can submit but we'll evaluate on a case-by-case basis.\n\nCritical payouts by Sherlock will only be paid out for critical bugs that would result in a loss of funds and can be executed profitably, and this then excludes Sherlock critical bounty payout for temporary freezing bugs.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Opyn__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USD__, __USDC__, __DAI__ or __ETH__.
