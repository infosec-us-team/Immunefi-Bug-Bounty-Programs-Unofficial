It will provide decentralized transaction services for all rTokens based on the StaFi Chain. Being an important part of the StaFi rToken ecosystem, rDEX V1 now is deployed on the StaFi chain, which is Substrate-based. Native rTokens minted by users can directly be traded through the rDEX for better liquidity.\n\nFor more information about rDEX, please visit [https://docs.rdex.finance/welcome-to-rdex/](https://docs.rdex.finance/welcome-to-rdex/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - The potential bugs or exploits in the slippage-based fee model and CLP liquidity pool model\n  - The potential bugs or exploits  in the liquidity mining contracts\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 2 days\n  - Smart contract gas drainage\n  - Block stuffing without fund transfers blocked",
