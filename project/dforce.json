It is the world’s first open finance project powered by a leading commercial bank.\n\nFurther resources regarding the dForce can be found on their website, [https://dforce.network/](https://dforce.network/). \n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and infrastructure and is mostly concerned with issues stated in the Impacts in Scope section.",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward, bug reports without a PoC will be rejected.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities for smart contracts are further defined by the following conditions. All need to be met in order to get the classification of critical. \n\n  - Allow attacker(s) to take away collateral tokens for at least 10% in dollar value of collateral tokens from the system.\n  - Are applied to a real situation and triggered through an attack vector rather than theory or hypothesis. \n  - Occur in operation mode or emergency shutdown mode, excluding those occurring during or shortly after the deployment when the system is yet to become fully activated.\n\nPlease note this Bug Bounty Program does not cover vulnerabilities pertaining to 1) protocols built by third-party developers (i.e., smart contract wallet); 2) ownership of an admin key.\n\nThe reward of critical smart contract vulnerabilities is capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into account the funds at risk. The dForce team may, at their discretion, decide to increase the reward based on PR and branding aspects.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __dForce__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
