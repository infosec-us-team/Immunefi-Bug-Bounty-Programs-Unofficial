      "programOverview": "dForce advocates for building an integrated and interoperable open finance protocol matrix covering  lending (global liquidity pool, yield markets), assets (stablecoin, synthetic asset, etc), and trading (liquidity aggregator, AMM).\n\nFeatures:\n  - Permission-less and open – everyone with internet access can participate.\n  - Non-custodial – minimal trust cost, users always have ownership over their crypoassets.\n  - Open-sourced – anyone can integrate with dForce and build your own product on top of our protocols.\n  - Decentralized – dForce (DF) token empowers the governance voting process.\n\ndForce is backed by a number of world-class investors including CMBI (China Merchant Bank International), Multicoin Capital, and Huobi Capital. It is the world’s first open finance project powered by a leading commercial bank.\n\nFurther resources regarding the dForce can be found on their website, [https://dforce.network/](https://dforce.network/). \n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and infrastructure and is mostly concerned with issues stated in the Impacts in Scope section.\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward, bug reports without a PoC will be rejected.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities for smart contracts are further defined by the following conditions. All need to be met in order to get the classification of critical. \n\n  - Allow attacker(s) to take away collateral tokens for at least 10% in dollar value of collateral tokens from the system.\n  - Are applied to a real situation and triggered through an attack vector rather than theory or hypothesis. \n  - Occur in operation mode or emergency shutdown mode, excluding those occurring during or shortly after the deployment when the system is yet to become fully activated.\n\nPlease note this Bug Bounty Program does not cover vulnerabilities pertaining to 1) protocols built by third-party developers (i.e., smart contract wallet); 2) ownership of an admin key.\n\nThe reward of critical smart contract vulnerabilities is capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into account the funds at risk. The dForce team may, at their discretion, decide to increase the reward based on PR and branding aspects.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __dForce__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __DF__.\n\nThe target asset is a link of Github which lists all major contracts of dForce suitable for bounty.",
