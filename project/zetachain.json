      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical Smart Contract, and Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 30 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. High Smart Contract, and Blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage as well, with a minimum reward of USD __10 000__.\n\nRewards for critical Web/App vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 15 000__ for Critical Smart Contract bug reports, and Blockchain/DLT. High Web/App vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage as well, with a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [PeckShield Audit ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cuWzLPjobQGafYLaVPZAHvyXTMOo0zbw/view?usp=sharing) October 2022\n  - [Veridise Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZOaVqXRPoYXPG2m1hSKvizhlbo29j4TJ/view?usp=sharing) October 2022\n  - [QuantumBrief Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N9JLdYaq6_gyruMrRDrrrl-JUHANQrI5/view?usp=sharing) October 2022\n  - [Zellic Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TjLkNn9MobjGTupukJBxnpxr0DKvj_6V/view?usp=drive_link), June 2023\n  - [Halborn Protocol Smart Contract Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bAWl19FlB2xLhg-lyZ_QwIBXEfWT9zX9/view?usp=drive_link), March 2023\n  - [Halborn ZetaNode Cosmos Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7RHWukeEcjUrA5P2BS3AYsttjYvQaw8/view?usp=sharing), March 2023\n  - [Halborn WebApp Explorer Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sli5-TFomGW2EmH-0Lt0J9iYJ3Ck8moF/view?usp=drive_link), May 2023\n  - [Halborn WebApp Backend Audit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iHw7p_FxFJ4DkKfO8qAKnRBPsKzgqxZd/view?usp=drive_link), May 2023\n\nZetaChain requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information required is a government ID along with a selfie.
