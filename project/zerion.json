      "programOverview": "At Zerion, we are on a mission to empower more people around the world with efficient, transparent, and censorship-resistant financial services. \n\nWe do this by building applications, tools, and infrastructure enabling any smartphone holder, anywhere in the world, to build and manage their decentralized finance (DeFi) portfolios. The company was founded in 2016 by a technical team of crypto-native builders who sought to change the way centralized financial services work, primarily driven by experiencing the lack of financial opportunity within their countries.\n\nZerion has grown to become one of the most popular DeFi interfaces in the world. Since inception, Zerion has processed over $1.4 billion in transaction volume and serves more than 200K monthly active users from over 217 countries.\n\nZerion gives customers access to more than 50,000 digital assets, 60 protocols & all NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain through their app, which streamlines the UI of DeFi. Users can access tokens and invest through the app similar to exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini, but do so using their own personal wallets like MetaMask, meaning user funds and private keys aren’t controlled by or accessible to Zerion.\n\nFor more information about Zerion, please visit [https://zerion.io/](https://zerion.io/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts, website and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds\n  - Leak of user data\n  - Deletion of user data",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports and Critical/High/Medium smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, all Critical/High/Medium bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nThe following known issues are considered to be out of scope of this bounty program: \n  - All issues highlighted previously in the following audit report: \n    - Peckshield Audit for DeFi SDK (August, 2020): [https://drive.google.com/file/d/158GG-J681xAc4d8pMibpP_SFJikX4HPM/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/158GG-J681xAc4d8pMibpP_SFJikX4HPM/view?usp=sharing)\n    - Audit: [https://github.com/zeriontech/defi-sdk/blob/interactive/audits/Zerion%20DeFi%20SDK%20Trail%20of%20Bits%20Audit%20Report.pdf](https://github.com/zeriontech/defi-sdk/blob/interactive/audits/Zerion%20DeFi%20SDK%20Trail%20of%20Bits%20Audit%20Report.pdf)\n  - External apps having integrations with Zerion\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with the full __USD 15 000__ only if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote. All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than __USD 10 000__.\n\nZerion requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is email address, full name, and country of residence.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Zerion__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC or DAI__.",
