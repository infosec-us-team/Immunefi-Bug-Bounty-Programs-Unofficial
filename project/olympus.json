It conducts autonomous and dynamic monetary policy, with market operations supported by the protocol-owned Olympus Treasury. \n\nFor more information about Olympus, please visit \n[https://www.olympusdao.finance/](https://www.olympusdao.finance/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n  - Loss of treasury funds\n  - Loss of user funds\n  - Loss of bond funds\n\nThis bug bounty program is managed by OlympusDAO under the provisions of [OIP-38](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/197-oip-38-formalize-partnership-with-immunefi-for-the-bug-bounty-program), an extension of [OIP-17](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/72-oip-17-creation-funding-of-bug-bounty-program) and [OIP-34](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/165-oip-34-adding-language-to-tier-1-of-bug-bounty). __Note that this bounty is not available to Olympus Contributors, who should go through the internal process found [here]__(https://discord.com/channels/@me/936109546143907911/1047907929413648476).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__ \n\n  - Any vulnerability that directly has an impact in scope.\n\n__Websites and Applications__\n\n  - Any vulnerability that directly has an impact in scope.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. Smart contract bug reports must have the PoC be fully runnable.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further subcategorized into four tiers:\n\n  - Tier 1: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of bond funds or a loss of user funds,a reward amount equal to the potential loss of funds up to __USD 333 333 (paid in OHM)__ is provided.\n\n  - Tier 2: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of treasury funds, a reward amount equal to the potential loss of funds up to __USD 3,333,333 (paid in OHM)__  is provided.\n\n  - Tier 3: For bugs/exploits which would lead to an incorrect rebase amount, a reward amount equal to the potential loss of funds up to __USD 33,333 (paid in OHM)__ is provided.\n\n  - Tier 4: The Bug Bounty Management team may from time to time, at its discretion, issue an award of up to $16,942.00 for submissions which do not qualify for bounties under other tiers, but which the team feels nonetheless are high effort, high quality, and of material use in improving Olympus’ security. Note that this bounty is not available to Olympus contributors, who should contact the Bug Bounty Management team directly for a bounty if they have found a bug or inefficiency that is outside of their mandate as a contributor. Further note that this bounty will not be awarded regularly. It is meant only for extremely high quality submissions which have significant material impacts to Olympus. No person submitting a bounty should assume that they are entitled to this or will be awarded it, as the bar to qualify for it will be very high.\n\nFor vulnerabilities of websites and applications, only bugs that lead to direct financial damage listed in the Impacts in Scope are accepted and are categorized as critical. All others are not accepted. An example of an acceptable vulnerability in this category would be [https://rekt.news/badger-rekt/](https://rekt.news/badger-rekt/).\n\nBugs that have been previously disclosed, either publicly or in an earlier bug submission, are ineligible for a reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Olympus DAO__ directly and are denominated in USD, under the terms set out in OIP-38. However, payouts are done in __OHM__.",
