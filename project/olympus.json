      "programOverview": "Olympus is a protocol with the goal of establishing OHM as a crypto-native reserve currency. It conducts autonomous and dynamic monetary policy, with market operations supported by the protocol-owned Olympus Treasury.\n\nFor more information about Olympus, please visit [https://www.olympusdao.finance/](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of treasury funds\n  - Loss of user funds\n  - Loss of bond funds\n\nThis bug bounty program is managed by OlympusDAO under the provisions of [OIP-38](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/197-oip-38-formalize-partnership-with-immunefi-for-the-bug-bounty-program), an extension of [OIP-17](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/72-oip-17-creation-funding-of-bug-bounty-program) and [OIP-34.](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/165-oip-34-adding-language-to-tier-1-of-bug-bounty/2) Note that this bounty is not available to Olympus Contributors, who should submit via the Olympus Discord page found [here](https://discord.com/channels/838651642190495804/905317734387175474/1192854877630627911).\n\nOlympus provides rewards in OHM, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nOlympus adheres to category __3 - Approval Required__. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nOlympus adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nOlympus commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Olympus will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nA full list of Olympus completed audit reports can be accessed below. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n  - [https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/security/audits](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/security/audits) \n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Olympus has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__ \n\n  - Any vulnerability that directly has an impact in scope.\n\n__Websites and Applications__\n\n  - Any vulnerability that directly has an impact in scope.",
      "rewardsBody": "This is a Custom Program, governed by __OlympusDAO__. The program is subcategorized into four tiers, with only the below impacts considered for a reward:\n\n  - Tier 1: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of bond funds or a loss of user funds, a reward amount equal to the potential loss of funds up to __USD 333 333__ (paid in OHM) is provided.\n\n  - Tier 2: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of treasury funds, a reward amount equal to the potential loss of funds up to __USD 3,333,333 __(paid in OHM) is provided.\n\n  - Tier 3: For bugs/exploits which would lead to an incorrect rebase amount, a reward amount equal to the potential loss of funds up to __USD 33,333__ (paid in OHM) is provided.\n\n  - Tier 4: The Bug Bounty Management team may from time to time, at its discretion, issue an award of up to __$16,942.00__ for submissions which do not qualify for bounties under other tiers, but which the team feels nonetheless are high effort, high quality, and of material use in improving Olympus’ security. Note that this bounty is not available to Olympus contributors, who should contact the Bug Bounty Management team directly for a bounty if they have found a bug or inefficiency that is outside of their mandate as a contributor. Further note that this bounty will not be awarded regularly. It is meant only for extremely high quality submissions which have significant material impacts to Olympus. No person submitting a bounty should assume that they are entitled to this or will be awarded it, as the bar to qualify for it will be very high.\n\nFor vulnerabilities of websites and applications, only bugs that lead to direct financial damage listed in the Impacts in Scope are accepted and are categorized as critical. All others are not accepted. An example of an acceptable vulnerability in this category would be [https://rekt.news/badger-rekt/ ](https://rekt.news/badger-rekt/)\n\nBugs that have been previously disclosed, either publicly or in an earlier bug submission, are ineligible for a reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Olympus DAO__ directly and are denominated in __USD__, under the terms set out in OIP-38. However, payouts are done in __OHM__.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Olympus__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __OHM__\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
