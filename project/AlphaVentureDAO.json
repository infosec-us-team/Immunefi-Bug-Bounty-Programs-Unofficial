These building blocks will interoperate, creating the Alpha ecosystem that will be an innovative and more capital efficient way to banking in DeFi. \n\nWe explore and innovate at the fringes of Web3 and drive significant value to Web3 users, and ultimately, alpha returns to the Alpha community.\n\nHomora V2 is Alpha Venture DAO’s first product and DeFi’s first leveraged yield farming product that captures the market gap in lending, one of the key pillars of the financial system.\n\nFurther information about Alpha Venture DAO can be found here \n[https://docs.alphaventuredao.io/](https://docs.alphaventuredao.io/).",

All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts/Blockchain__\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Loss of governance funds\n  - Undesirable flashloan/sandwich exploits\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Smart contract gas drainage\n  - Block stuffing without fund transfers blocked\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn’t lose value\n\n__Web/App__\n\n  - Redirected funds by address modification\n  - Accessing sensitive pages without authorization\n  - Persistent injection of text or script\n  - Users spoofing other users\n  - Shell access on server\n  - Loss of treasury funds\n  - Loss of user funds\n  - Incorrect calculations e.g. slippage control that can lead to funds loss",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. For Smart Contract bug reports, PoCs and suggestions for a fix are not required but good to have and encouraged. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. This includes a bounty of up to USD 500,000 from the Alpha Venture DAO team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Alpha Venture DAO__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __ALPHA__ for payouts up to USD 500,000. For critical level smart contract vulnerabilities, payouts of up to USD 500,000 will take place with an upfront payout of up to USD 100,000 and USD 50,000 monthly vesting thereafter. .",
