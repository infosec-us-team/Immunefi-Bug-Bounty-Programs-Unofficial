For Smart Contract bug reports, PoCs and suggestions for a fix are not required but good to have and encouraged. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. This includes a bounty of up to USD 500,000 from the Alpha Venture DAO team. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Alpha Venture DAO__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __ALPHA__ for payouts up to USD 500,000. For critical level smart contract vulnerabilities, payouts of up to USD 500,000 will take place with an upfront payout of up to USD 100,000 and USD 50,000 monthly vesting thereafter. ",
