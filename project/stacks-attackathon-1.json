Bugs in the audit report that aren't disclosed are valid for rewards.\n\nThis Attackathon’s code is/will be on mainnet during the competition. Code cannot be frozen because the project may need to immediately mitigate severe bugs in live code. The following conditions apply:\n- The project will share detailed changelogs when code changes are released during the Attackathon on Discord and they will be documented in our [Stacks changelog](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/30737752973073-Stacks-Attackathon-1-Code-Update-Changelog).\n- Duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward until those bugs are shared publicly.\n- Read our [Code Update Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/30553426831633-Stacks-Attackathon-1-Code-Update-Rules) for further details on how code updates will be allowed & communicated \n\n**Responsible Publication**\n\nSecurity Researchers may publish their bug reports, but only after Immunefi has released all of the raw bug reports as part of the contest results, with the following exceptions:\n\n- Bug reports in evaluation may not be published until the evaluation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this Attackathon, as well as a leaderboard showing the participants and their earnings.",

Which are not?\n\n- SIP10 is the only token standard supported https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md \n\nWhat emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?\n\n- Deposit processing can be paused by shutting down the Emily API server. In the case of vulnerabilities in deposit handling, this can be used to reduce the impact of an ongoing attack.\n\nWhat addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?\n\n- Signers are permissioned and whitelisted operators. Any attack that requires a majority of signers to be malicious should be out of scope. Attacks that require a minority of signers to be malicious would still be in scope but with reduced severity. \n\nWhich chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?\n\n- Stacks L2\n\n## Security Researcher Education\n\nIs this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?\n\n- sBTC is a new 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on the Stacks Bitcoin L2. The in-scope codebase is completely new. \n\nWhere do you suspect there may be bugs?\n\n- The end-to-end flow of processing new Bitcoin deposits and minting sBTC on Stacks is relatively complex and error prone. Issues here could allow DoS of valid deposits or incorrect minting of unbacked sBTC.\n\nVulnerabilities in the sBTC smart contracts hosted on Stacks could break the core assumptions of the system. Any attack that leads to a mismatch between the BTC collateral and the sBTC would be highly interesting to us.\n\n- Any attacks against the threshold signature scheme used on Bitcoin\n\nWhere might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?\n\n- Vulnerabilities in the Stacks L2 blockchain itself should be reported directly to the [Stacks Immunefi bug bounty](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/stacks/information/). \n\n- The initial launch of sBTC does not enable withdrawals back to Bitcoin. While partial code to support withdrawals can be found in the codebase, issues that can’t be exploited in “deposit-only” mode will be downgraded.\n\nAre there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?\n\n- sBTC launches without support for withdrawals. Users can go from BTC -> sBTC, but the support for sBTC -> BTC is not fully implemented. This functionality will be part of a follow-up contest.",

This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n- https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22flagged+by+AR%22\n- https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc/issues\n\nThe project will share detailed changelogs when code changes are released during the Attackathon on Discord and they will be documented in our [Stacks changelog](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/30737752973073-Stacks-Attackathon-1-Code-Update-Changelog).\n\n**Previous Audits**\n\nStacks’s completed audit reports can be found at https://stacks.org/audits.

The following information will be required:\n- Full name\n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers are required to submit KYC within 14 days of KYC being requested, else their rewards may be forfeited.

      "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
