      "programOverview": "zkSync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or decentralization. Since it's EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring or re-auditing a single line of code. zkSync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers write smart contracts in C++, Rust and other popular languages.\n\nFor more information about zkSync Era, please visit [https://zksync.io/](https://zksync.io/)\n\n__For Whitehats__: It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success. \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the Immunefi [Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "__Reward Distribution:__\n\nPlease review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/) This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements:__\n\nRewards for critical smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk based on the PoC provided.. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__.\n\nFor the project's bug bounty program, high-severity smart contract vulnerability rewards are determined according to an internal set of criteria established by the team. These criteria take into account the exploitability, impact, and probability of the vulnerability occurring, with special consideration given to bug reports that require multiple conditions not currently in place. There is a minimum reward of __USD 20,000__ for high-severity level vulnerabilities, and the maximum reward is capped at 100% of the affected funds, up to the max high cap, whichever is lower.\n\nPayouts are handled by the zkSync team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in USDC (zkSync Era). zkSync commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements:__\n\nzkSync Era has a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. Government identification is required for the KYC process.\n\n__Responsible publication__\n\nzkSync Era adheres to **category 3**. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nzkSync Era commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that zkSync Era will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues:__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n- [https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/audit-bug-bounty#audits](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/audit-bug-bounty#audits)\nA separate note on the fee model: zkSync has different gas prices per opcodes than Ethereum. Also, it is known that since gasPerPubdataByte is fluctuating, it may lead for gasLimits to not be reliable in the middle/long-term. \n\nThe fee model is still in development and so the operator may not be fully compensated. The impact of griefing attacks will be evaluated based on the ratio between funds spent by the attacker and the funds spent by the operator.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following impacts and attack vectors are excluded from rewards by default for all Immunefi bug bounty programs: \n\n- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, operator), except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Broken link hijacking is out of scope\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n- Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Best practice critiques\n- Sybil attacks\n- Centralization risks\n\n__Websites and Apps__\n\n- Theoretical impacts without any proof or demonstration\n- Content spoofing / Text injection issues\n- Self-XSS\n- Captcha bypass using OCR\n- CSRF with no security impact (logout CSRF, change language, etc.)\\\n- Missing HTTP Security Headers (such as X-FRAME-OPTIONS) or cookie security flags (such as “httponly”)\n- Server-side information disclosure such as IPs, server names, and most stack traces\n- Vulnerabilities used to enumerate or confirm the existence of users or tenants\n- Vulnerabilities requiring unlikely user actions\n- URL Redirects (unless combined with another vulnerability to produce a more severe vulnerability)\n- Lack of SSL/TLS best practices\n- Attacks involving DDoS\n- Attacks requiring privileged access from within the organization\n- SPF records for email domains\n- Feature requests\n- Best practices\n\n__Blockchain/DLT__\n\n- Attacks requiring changing the verifier key\n\n__Prohibited Activities:__\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program. Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: 1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and 2) zero payout. \n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited: \n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n- [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules.](https://immunefi.com/rules/) These rules are subject to change at any time.",
