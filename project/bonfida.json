      "programOverview": "Developer of blockchain technologies intended to provide consumers with a Web 3.0 identity. The company's primary product, Solana Name Service (SNS) provides a human-readable name that maps to an SOL address, thereby removing the barrier to entry and providing an identifiable address that can facilitate payments, efficiency, and overall user experience in the sphere.\n\nFor more information about Bonfida, please visit [https://bonfida.org/en](https://bonfida.org/en) \n\nBonfida provides rewards in FIDA. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n\n- Wallet address where you’ll receive payment;\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with your address or a recent utility bill with your name, address, and issuer of the bill);\n- Copy of your passport will be required.\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nBonfida adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nBonfida adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Smart Contract - Low\n- Websites & Applications - Critical\n- Websites & Applications - High\n- Websites & Applications - Medium\n- Websites & Applications - Low\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nBonfida commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Bonfida will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBonfida has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- OFAC-sanctioned countries residents are ineligible \n- OFAC-sanctioned individuals are ineligible\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical - PoC Required \n- Smart Contract - High - PoC Required \n- Smart Contract - Medium - PoC Required \n- Smart Contract - Low - PoC Required \n- Website & Applications - Critical - PoC Required\n- Website & Applications - High - PoC Required\n- Website & Applications - Medium - PoC Required\n- Website & Applications - Low - PoC Required\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).

However, payments are done in FIDA.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.\n",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "These impacts are out of scope for this bug bounty program. \n\n__All Categories__\n\n- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist) except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code\n- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Feature requests\n- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity impacts\n- Impacts from Sybil attacks\n- Impacts involving centralization risks\n- Best practice recommendations\n\n__Websites & Applications__\n\n- Theoretical impacts without any proof or demonstration\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring physical access to the victim device\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring access to the local network of the victim\n- Captcha bypass using OCR without impact demonstration\n- CSRF with no state modifying security impact (e.g. logout CSRF)\n- Impacts related to missing HTTP Security Headers (such as X-FRAME-OPTIONS) or cookie security flags (such as “httponly”) without demonstration of impact\n- Server-side non-confidential information disclosure, such as IPs, server names, and most stack traces\n- Impacts causing only the enumeration or confirmation of the existence of users or tenants\n- Impacts caused by vulnerabilities requiring un-prompted, in-app user actions that are not part of the normal app workflows\n- Lack of SSL/TLS best practices\n- Impacts that only require DDoS\n- UX and UI impacts that do not materially disrupt use of the platform\n- Impacts primarily caused by browser/plugin defects\n- Leakage of non sensitive API keys (e.g. Etherscan, Infura, Alchemy, etc.)\n- Any vulnerability exploit requiring browser bugs for exploitation (e.g. CSP bypass) \n- SPF/DMARC misconfigured records\n- Missing HTTP Headers without demonstrated impact\n- Automated scanner reports without demonstrated impact\n- UI/UX best practice recommendations\n- Non-future-proof NFT rendering\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n- Any testing on mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on local-forks of either public testnet or mainnet\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third-party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third-party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks that are executed against project assets\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n",
