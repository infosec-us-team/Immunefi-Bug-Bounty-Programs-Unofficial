      "programOverview": "[DeGate](https://degate.com/) is a decentralized orderbook exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain that utilizes zero-knowledge technology. DeGate DEX offers spot market trading with limit orders and also offers a grid trading function.\n\nDeGate operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DEX platform is focused on being user-friendly and is built on the principle of Trustlessness. With DeGate’s unique Efficient Gas Saving technology, users can expect super-low gas fees while using a decentralized protocol. Another critical component of DeGate is the Permissionless Listing feature which enables any token to be listed in a permissionless manner on DeGate’s orderbook DEX.\n\nFor more information about DeGate, please visit [https://docs.degate.com/](https://docs.degate.com/).\n\nDeGate Testnet is currently live on[ https://testnet.degate.com/](https://testnet.degate.com/), and more details can be found in the product documentation ([https://docs.degate.com/v/product_en/overview](https://docs.degate.com/v/product_en/overview))\n\nThe bounty environment has been deployed on Public Testnet, whose code was open sourced on [Github](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/tree/degate1.0.0?utm_source=immunefi), along with the [Protocol Specification Doc](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate1.1.0/DeGate%20Protocol%20Specification%20Document.md?utm_source=immunefi)s, [Circuit Design Docs](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate1.1.0/Circuit%20Design.md?utm_source=immunefi) and [Smart Contract Design Docs](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate1.1.0/Smart%20Contract%20Design.md?utm_source=immunefi).\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty Programs have standard terms and conditions, this is a Custom Program which has its own unique set of impacts and eligibility requirements.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __DeGate__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payouts are done in __USDC__. DeGate commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. For more information, please see Rewards by Threat Level section further down below. \n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see Best Practices: Primacy of Impact \nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n*If the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Smart Contracts and Zero Knowledge Proof Circuit__\n\n__Smart Contracts and Circuit - PoC__, Regarding the 'Critical' level issues, the Proof of Concept (POC) for the circuit and smart contract is valid only if the white hat individuals involved can show that they can initiate and carry out attacks on their own. There is no such restriction for POCs of levels other than 'Critical'.Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nFor more information on PoCs please visit: [Proof of Concept (PoC) Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\nAll smart contracts of DeGate can be found at: [https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/tree/degate1.1.0/packages/loopring_v3/contracts](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/tree/degate1.1.0/packages/loopring_v3/contracts)\n\n__Web/App__ \n\n__Web/App__ - Bug reports are to include a runnable Proof of Concept (PoC) in order to prove impact. \n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All PoC content must adhere to the [PoC guidelines and rules of Immunefi](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules). In the event that a PoC requires an attack on a web/app asset provided, they must still adhere to the rules provided, otherwise eligibility for a reward may be revoked. \nFor more information on PoCs please visit: [Proof of Concept (PoC) Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nDeGate commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that DeGate will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nDeGate’s completed audit reports and known issues can be found at:\n\n[\nhttps://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/Trailofbits%20-%20DeGate%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/Trailofbits%20-%20DeGate%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf)(Previous code)\n\n[https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/Least%20Authority%20-%20DeGate%20DAO%20DeGate%20Smart%20Contracts%20Updated%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/Least%20Authority%20-%20DeGate%20DAO%20DeGate%20Smart%20Contracts%20Updated%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf)  (Previous code)\n\n[https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/Least%20Authority%20-%20DeGate%20Technology%20DeGate%20zk-SNARK%20Circuit%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/Least%20Authority%20-%20DeGate%20Technology%20DeGate%20zk-SNARK%20Circuit%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf) (Previous code)\n\n[https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/DeGate_Report_EN-final2023.pdf](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/DeGate_Report_EN-final2023.pdf) (Previous code)\n\n[https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/DeGate_Report_EN-final20230912.pdf](https://github.com/degatedev/protocols/blob/degate_mainnet/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/DeGate_Report_EN-final20230912.pdf) (Latest code)\n\nAny unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, DeGate has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are considered out-of-scope and ineligible for payout.",
      "rewardsBody": "__Reward Distribution__\n\nPlease review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). This is a simplified 4-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical and high smart contract bugs, the reward amount is paid at a fixed rate of __$1.1M and $100,000__ respectively. This means than in order to qualify, the security researcher must demonstrate: \n\n__Reward of $1.1M:__\n\n  - Direct theft of funds greater than $1M  \n  - Direct permanent freezing of funds greater than $2.5M\n\n__Reward of 100K:__\n\n  - Direct theft of funds less than $1M\n  - Direct permanent freezing of less than $2.5M\n  - Theft of any funds that requires malicious actions of DeGate operator\n  - Permanent freezing of any funds requires malicious actions of DeGate operator\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n  - If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n  - For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that can not be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to __10%__ of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n  - In the event of temporary freezing, the reward increases at a multiplier of two from the full frozen value for every additional 15 days that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature. \n\nFor critical web/apps, bug reports will be rewarded with __USD 100 000__, only if the impact leads to a direct loss of funds without any user action required.\n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded within the range based on demonstrated ‘non-funds at risk’ impact, at the discretion of DeGate. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table. \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.\n",
