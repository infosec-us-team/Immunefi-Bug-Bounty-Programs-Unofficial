In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards?utm_source=immunefi) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). This is a simplified 4-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 50 000.\n\nVulnerabilities concerning temporary freezing of funds, where the impact affects more than one user, the reward increases at a multiplier of 1.5 from the Medium Reward category for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the High Reward category. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Gains Network__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __GNS and DAI__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nGains Network adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\nSmart Contract - Critical\nSmart Contract - High\nSmart Contract - Medium\nWebsites and Applications - Critical\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact?utm_source=immunefi).",

All facets of the diamond are considered in-scope for this bounty.\n\nMore generally, any active smart contract deployed by the Gains Network protocol containing or having the ability to impact significant Gains Network users funds (>$100k) is considered as in-scope. For example gDAI is listed above but we didn’t list every gToken (gETH, gUSDC, and any future gToken) for practical reasons.\n\nFor the same reasons, we also didn’t list every deprecated version of our previous NFTs (which can be redeemed for $GNS) to not clog up assets in scope, however if a vulnerability is found in these old contracts that can affect current Gains Network user funds, it will be considered in-scope.\n\nIn summary, if an impact can be caused to any other asset managed by Gains Network that isn’t on this table but for which the impact is in the Impacts in Scope section, you are encouraged to submit it for the consideration of the project.",
