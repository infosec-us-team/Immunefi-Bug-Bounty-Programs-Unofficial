      "programOverview": "JOJO is a decentralized perpetual contract exchange based on a pure on-chain perpetual contract ledger and an off-chain matching system, which could provide much deeper liquidity than the AMM type of perpetual contracts.\n\nFor more information about JOJO, please visit [https://jojo.exchange/ ](https://jojo.exchange/) \n\nJOJO provides rewards in USDT and USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nJOJO adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nJOJO adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nJOJO commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that JOJO will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nJOJO has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge,](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-) which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- Incompatibility with Deflationary Tokens: primary asset and secondary asset are standard ERC20 token\n- Missing Zero Address Validation\n- Removal of `Perpetual`：It is the normal logic, delist the perpetual\n- Low-level Call: About the execute operation of Subaccount.\n- Address Poisoning Attack: caused by the user's wrong copy address and team can not do something for help.\n- Asset losses of less than 1e-2 due to loss of precision are not considered\n- Centralization Risk: admin have excessive authority, FundingRateKeeper role, JOJO operation role, valid orderSender, emergency oracle owner, insurance account. All have used multi-sig.\n- Unused contract: in the delist, we will replace the oracle to make the price anchored a fixed price\n- Open positions are discarded if `Perpetual` is deregistered: only remove when no position\n- Third Party Dependencies: chainlink Oracle Failed\n- Potential Reentrancy Attack:\n   - _settle() after IDealer(owner()).requestLiquidation\n   - change secondaryCredit after IERC20(state.primaryAsset).safeTransfer(to, primaryAmount); in funding.sol\n   - change secondaryAsset after IDecimalERC20(_secondaryAsset).decimals() in Operation.sol\n- DOS attack possible for trading: only valid msg.sender can call approveTrade. If there are too many orders and cannot be matched, we will divide them into multiple transactions.\n- setOperator function is missing onlyOwner modifier: this function is aiming to set every user own operator so no need modifier\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nJOJO has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/fix-review/audit/JOJO_Exchange_Audit_Report.pdf](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/fix-review/audit/JOJO_Exchange_Audit_Report.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/fix-review/audit/REP-final-20230109T013939Z.pdf](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/fix-review/audit/REP-final-20230109T013939Z.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/fix-review/audit/SlowMist%20Audit%20Report%20-%20JOJOexchange.pdf](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/fix-review/audit/SlowMist%20Audit%20Report%20-%20JOJOexchange.pdf)\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nBug reports that require an attack that involve one or more other protocols (e.g. utilizing flash loans from a margin protocol or manipulating the spot prices on a DEX), either to make an attack more severe than it would be in isolation, or to achieve an attack that would otherwise be impossible or infeasible, would be making the report out-of-scope. However, they will be considered as in-scope and categorized according to the program rules as long as all of the following are true:\n- Losses or other negative effects of the attack are inflicted upon JOJO ecosystem participants \n- The additional protocols used must have enough liquidity in various assets to allow the attack to succeed at the time of bug report submission. For example: if an attack requires an ETH flash loan, but the amount is larger than all the ETH available for loan across the ecosystem\n- Timestamp manipulation to bypass the time lock.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium\n- Web/App - Critical\n- Web/App - High\n- Web/App - Medium\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the [Immunefi-wide PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the JOJO team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDT and USDC. \n",
