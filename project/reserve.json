      "programOverview": "The Reserve Protocol is the first platform that allows for the permissionless creation of asset-backed, yield-bearing & overcollateralized stablecoins on Ethereum. The end goal of the Reserve Protocol is to provide highly scalable, decentralized, stable money in contrast to volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nIn our view, clear flaws can be demonstrated with many existing stablecoin designs. In the 2018 Reserve Protocol whitepaper, we present arguments for why a widely used stablecoin should implement an exchange rate peg to a fiat currency first and a basket of assets later, using off-chain foreign collateral that has been tokenized by a diversity of issuers.\n\nFurthermore, we believe that open exploration and competition can lead to the discovery of the best type of basket and governance system for ideal on-chain money. There's a lot to explore, and it's better not to keep that under the control of the initial founding team. For this reason, the Reserve Protocol is entirely permissionless — allowing anyone to deploy a Reserve stablecoin (RToken) with their preferred collateral basket, governance system and revenue distribution.\n\nFor more information about Reserve, please visit [https://reserve.org/](https://reserve.org/)\n\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)\n\nIf the bug report has been closed, and 2 weeks has passed since final upgrade, and the security researcher does not want to publish but Reserve would like to publish, then Reserve will take over all intellectual property of the bug report and can publish at will in coordination with Immunefi.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are considered out-of-scope and ineligible for payout.",
      "rewardsBody": "Please review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/) This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 5% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 100 000.\n\nRewards for high smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 5% of the funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.  However, there is a minimum reward of USD 10 000 for High smart contract bug reports.\n\n| Impact     | Criteria for assessing economic damage     |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| Temporary freezing of RToken ERC20 functionality (% TVL frozen at time of submission)       | Temporary freezing time < 24hr: medium. 24hr < Temporary freezing time < *governance cycle + 1 day: high, 1%. *governance cycle + 1 day < Temporary freezing time:  high       |\n| Temporary freezing of funds       | Temporary freezing time < 24hr: medium 1%. 24hr < Temporary freezing time < *governance cycle + 1 day8 days: high, 12%. *governance cycle + 1 day8 days < Temporary freezing time: 5% high       |\n\n* governance cycle = the total time between when a proposal is made to when it can be executed. For eUSD, 1 governance cycle = 2 days (voting delay) + 3 days (voting period) + 3 days (execution delay) = 8 days\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Reserve team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in USDC and RSR. Reserve commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Rules program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements__\n\nReserve does have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\n__KYC Info Required__\n- Anyone who receives $600 or more from our company will need to either provide their US taxpayer information via a form W-9, or a W-8BEN declaring that they are not a US taxpayer subject to withholding.\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.  \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n\n| Description of known issue     | Related Impact-in-Scope     |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| Asset.lotPrice() doesn't use the most recent price in case of oracle timeout ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/326](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/326))       | Smart-Contract       |\n| Unsafe cast of uint8 datatype to int8 ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/265](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/265))       | Smart-Contract       |\n| refresh() will revert on Oracle deprecation, effectively disabling part of the protocol ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/234](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/234))       | Smart-Contract       |\n| Shortfall might be calculated incorrectly if a price value for one collateral isn't fetched correctly ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/200](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/200))       | Smart-Contract       |\n| BasketHandler: Users might not be able to redeem their rToken when protocol is paused due to refreshBasket function ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/39](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/39))       | Smart-Contract       |\n| Attacker can cause loss to rToken holders and stakers by running BackingManager._manageTokens before rewards are claimed ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/22](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/22))       | Smart-Contract       |\n| StRSR: attacker can steal excess rsr that is returned after seizure ([https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/17](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-reserve-mitigation-contest-findings/issues/17))       | Smart-Contract       |\n| [All audit reports (Ackee, Halborn, Solidified, Trail of Bits) ](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/tree/master/audits)      | Smart-Contract       |",
