This means the project will not leak info about any bug findings or planned bug fixes, including bug findings found independently by the project or from concurrent private audits.\n\n------------------\n\n**Previous Audits**\n\nFirelight’s completed audit reports can be found at https://firelight.finance/audit.pdf. Unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n**Public Disclosure of Known Issues**\n\nBug reports for publicly disclosed bugs are not eligible for a reward. \n\nInflation attack: This is a known issue with ERC-4626 described at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc4626#security-concern-inflation-attack We'll take care of this at the time of deployment.\n\n**Private Known Issues Reward Policy**\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward.\n\n-----------------------\n\n**Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\nThere should be no confusion. Only one smart contract and its storage contract are in scope.\n\n**Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nNo, this is not an upgrade of an existing system and will be a first-time deployment.\n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs and/or what attack vectors are you most concerned about?**\n\nOverall security and correctness are especially important.\n\n\n**What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported?**\n\nThe vault is ERC-4626 compliant and holds/transfers ERC-20 tokens. No ERC-721, ERC-777, or ERC-1155 tokens are supported.\n\n**What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?**\n\nNone.\nWe do not use emergency actions as a basis to downgrade severity.\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nThe role-based administrative addresses are considered trusted.These roles are intentionally authorized to modify configurations or perform emergency actions. Their intended permissions are not considered vulnerabilities.\nThis includes: DEPOSIT_LIMIT_UPDATE_ROLE, RESCUER_ROLE, BLOCKLIST_ROLE, PAUSE_ROLE,  PERIOD_CONFIGURATION_UPDATE_ROLE\n\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?**\nNone. \n\n**Which chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?**\n\nFlare Network. https://flare-explorer.flare.network/\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\nThere are no external dependencies. The system does not rely on oracles, price feeds, or external protocol integrations.\n\n**Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?**\n\nWe do not think so. The time-based period configuration may be slightly unusual, but the implementation is straightforward and self-explanatory in the code.\n\n**What are the most valuable educational resources already available? (Ie. Documentation, Explainer videos or articles, etc)**\n\nhttps://github.com/firelight-protocol/firelight-core/blob/main/README.md",
