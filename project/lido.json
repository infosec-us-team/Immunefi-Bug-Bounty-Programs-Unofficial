  "programOverview": "Lido is a liquid staking solution for Ethereum, backed by industry-leading staking providers and community stakers. It allows users to stake their ETH without locking up assets or maintaining infrastructure, while still participating in on-chain activities.\n\nLido aims to solve the key challenges of early Ethereum staking — illiquidity, immovability, and limited accessibility — by making staked ETH liquid and enabling participation with any amount. This helps strengthen the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nFor more information about Lido, please visit [Lido.fi](https://lido.fi/). \n\nThe bug bounty program covers its smart contracts and applications, focusing on preventing loss of user funds, some types of denial of service attacks, governance hijacks, data breaches, and data leaks.\n\n**Relationship with Lido's Safe Harbor Program**\n\nBug Bounty is distinct from [Lido's Safe Harbor Program](https://docs.lido.fi/security/safeharbor):\n\n- Bug bounty: for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities before an active exploit, following Immunefi rules.\n- Safe Harbor: for live, active exploits where immediate intervention is needed and normal disclosure is too slow.\n\nSafe Harbor and the Bug Bounty program are mutually exclusive from a rewards perspective. A Whitehat rewarded via the Bug Bounty program cannot receive a reward for the same exploit under Safe Harbor, even if Safe Harbor's legal protections apply.",
