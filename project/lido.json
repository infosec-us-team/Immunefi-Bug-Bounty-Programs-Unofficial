It allows users to stake their ETH without locking up assets or maintaining infrastructure, while still participating in on-chain activities.\n\nLido aims to solve the key challenges of early Ethereum staking — illiquidity, immovability, and limited accessibility — by making staked ETH liquid and enabling participation with any amount. This helps strengthen the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nFor more information about Lido, please visit [Lido.fi](https://lido.fi/). \n\nThe bug bounty program covers its smart contracts and applications, focusing on preventing loss of user funds, some types of denial of service attacks, governance hijacks, data breaches, and data leaks.",
