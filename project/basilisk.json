      "programOverview": "Basilisk is a liquidity protocol built for the Kusama ecosystem. Its mission is to enable permissionless liquidity that caters to the evolving needs of crypto assets - both fungible, and non-fungible (NFTs).\n\nThe modular design of Basilisk enables fungible assets to bootstrap liquidity by choosing the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model which they find the most convenient. The first version comes with an implementation of [Snek Swap (XYK) pools](https://docs.bsx.fi/product_snek_swap) which allow users to buy and sell tokens, or to become a liquidity provider and earn rewards generated from trades.\n\nFurther iterations for fungibles will deliver a liquidity mining pallet allowing the protocol to incentivize liquidity provisioning to selected pools. Moreover, the Basilisk implementation of Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBP) enables young crypto projects to bootstrap initial liquidity and achieve a fair token distribution across their communities.\n\nFor the non-fungibles (NFTs), Basilisk features a Marketplace which supports functions such as putting NFTs up for sale, setting royalty fees, and the ability to make an offer for unlisted NFTs. Future iterations will bring an auction functionality allowing users to bid on NFTs (with 3 auction types - English, Top Up and Candle).\n\nFor more information about Basilisk, please visit [https://bsx.fi/](https://bsx.fi/).",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All High and Critical blockchain/DLT bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 20 000__. \n\nHigh blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nCritical web/app vulnerabilities are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place.

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
