Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. \n\nIn addition, all bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix to be considered for a reward. \n\nKnown issues highlights in the following audit report are considered out of scope:\n  - [https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-02-foundation/](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-02-foundation/)\n\nFoundation requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward.
