Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.</p><p>The bug report must be directly exploitable by a party (i.e the vulnerability must be exploitable directly by a user/party according to the PoC) in order to be valid and eligible for a reward, and not be dependent on  external events (i.e An asset price should move by X, or an external protocol the contracts are interacting with needs to malfunction for the issue to be realizes/exploitable)</p><p>Critical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of <strong>USD 17,500 to 35,000 depending on the type of funds at risk</strong>.</p><p><strong>Smart Contracts (Critical)</strong></p><ul><li>Loss of user funds:<ul><li>10% of assets at risk, minimum USD 35, 000; maximum USD 150, 000</li></ul></li><li>Loss of non-user funds (e.g. treasury):<ul><li>10% of assets at risk, minimum USD 17, 500; maximum USD 150, 000</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Smart Contracts (High)</strong></p><ul><li>Temporary freezing of funds for more than 7 days (other than unclaimed yield):<ul><li>10% of assets at risk, minimum USD 5, 000; maximum USD 25, 000</li></ul></li><li>Permanent freezing/theft of unclaimed yield:<ul><li>10% of assets at risk, minimum USD 2, 000; maximum USD 25, 000</li></ul></li></ul><p>All vulnerabilities marked in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Brahma-fi/brahma-security/tree/master/audits\">https://github.com/Brahma-fi/brahma-security/tree/master/audits</a> are not eligible for a reward. </p><p>Payouts are handled by the <strong>Brahma</strong> team directly and are denominated in USD.
