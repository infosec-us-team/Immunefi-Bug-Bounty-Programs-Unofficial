      "programOverview": "Optimism is a project dedicated to scaling Ethereum's technology and expanding its ability to coordinate people from across the world to build effective decentralized economies and governance systems. \n\nThe OP Stack is the modular, decentralized software stack that powers Optimism, forms the backbone of blockchains like OP Mainnet and Base, and is maintained by the Optimism Collective . \n\nThe first release of the OP Stack codebase is called Bedrock. The Bedrock release primarily consists of the core software required to run L2 blockchains and was originally designed to power an upgrade to the OP Mainnet network. Bedrock improves on its predecessor by reducing transaction fees using optimized batch compression and Ethereum as a data availability layer; shortening delays of including L1 transactions in rollups by handling L1 re-orgs more gracefully; enabling modular proof systems through code re-use; and improving node performance by removing technical debt.\n\nTo read more about Optimism, please visit [https://www.optimism.io/](https://www.optimism.io/). To learn about the OP Stack, please visit [https://stack.optimism.io/](https://stack.optimism.io/). \n\nThis bounty program is focused on preventing\n\n- Theft of assets held in their smart contracts;\n- Theft, freezing or other loss of funds due to vulnerabilities in the smart contracts’ or the critical blockchain client services (op-node and op-geth).\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nOptimism adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Smart Contract  —  Critical\n- Smart Contract  —  High\n- Smart Contract  —  Medium\n- Blockchain/DLT  —  Critical\n- Blockchain/DLT  —  High\n- Blockchain/DLT  —  Medium\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "__Impacts in Scope__\n\nOnly the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts/Blockchain__\n\n  - Loss of user funds by permanent freezing or direct theft\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for significantly longer than is enforced by the withdrawal delay.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/) This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nSince Optimism uses a fork of Geth, issues which are responsibly disclosed to upstream cannot be \"replayed\" against Optimism’s bug bounty program if the vulnerability has already been made public. If the vulnerability is disclosed to Optimism at the same time as upstream Geth, the vulnerability is eligible for the bug bounty program.\n\nAll reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nFor KYC, OptimismPBC will request a W-9 if you reside in the US or a W-8 if you reside outside the US.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 75 000__ for Critical bug reports.\n\nFor testing any exploits involving cross-domain transactions, we recommend working with our [dockerized services](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6f8e432506a5f4ba094f091b22a0bb6acc53fdac/ops/README.md) and modifying our [integration tests](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6f8e432506a5f4ba094f091b22a0bb6acc53fdac/integration-tests/test/bridged-tokens.spec.ts)\n\n__Governance Proposals:__\n\nIn addition to the above assets listed, the calldata and code for the latest Protocol Upgrade Proposals (not for Governor Upgrade proposals, or proposal previews) is also in scope. This must be an official governance proposal, meaning it has either (1) moved to onchain vote appearing on vote.optimism.io, or (2) has been posted by someone from OP Labs or the Optimism Foundation, or (3) a comment has been left by someone from OP Labs or the Optimism Foundation indicating it's eligible for the bounty. The latest in-flight governance proposal can be found at https://gov.optimism.io/c/technical-proposals/protocol-upgrade/.",
