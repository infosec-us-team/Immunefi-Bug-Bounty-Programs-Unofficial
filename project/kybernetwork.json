Our flagship product, [KyberSwap](http://www.kyberswap.com), is a next-gen DEX aggregator providing the best rates for traders and maximizing returns for liquidity providers in DeFi. \n\nFor more information about Kyber Network, please visit [https://kyber.network/.  ](https://kyber.network/)\n\nKyber Network provides rewards in USDC and KNC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nKyber Network adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nKyber Network adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels  \n- Smart Contract, Critical Severity Level \n- Smart Contract, High Severity Level \n- Smart Contract, Medium Severity Level \n- Smart Contract, Low Severity Level \n- Website/Applications, Critical Severity Level\n- Website/Applications, High Severity Level\n- Website/Applications, Medium Severity Level\n- Website/Applications, Low Severity Level\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nKyber Network commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Kyber Network will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical 1 Level Reports__\n\nFor Critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is __5%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 200,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 20,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level 2 Reports__ \n\nFor Critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is __5%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 100,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 20,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor High Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is __5%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 20,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 5,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Medium Level Reports__\n\nFor Medium Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is __5%__ of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of __USD 5,000__. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of __USD 1,000__ is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. However, the reward for Smart contract unable to operate due to logic issue impact is fixed at __USD 1,000__. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- [https://100proof.org/kyberswap-post-mortem.html ](https://100proof.org/kyberswap-post-mortem.html)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nKyber Network has provided these completed audit review reports for reference.
