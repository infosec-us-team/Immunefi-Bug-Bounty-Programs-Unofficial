This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAudit Discoveries and Known Issues\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue (e.g., the use of deprecated Chainlink API was reported in [EXA-36](https://github.com/exactly/audits/blob/main/Coinspect%204th%20audit%20(Oct-22).pdf)), it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi.\n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at: [https://docs.exact.ly/security/audits](https://docs.exact.ly/security/audits).\n\nAll High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 25 000__. \n\nKYC is required for this bug bounty program. Government identification, legal name, and country of residence will need to be supplied.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Exactly__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC and DAI__, with the choice of the ratio at the team's discretion.",

This only applies to Critical and High impacts.\n\nPeriphery Contracts have a reward cap equal to “High” (USD 25 000).
