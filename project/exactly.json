      "programOverview": "Exactly is a decentralized, non-custodial, and open-source protocol that provides an autonomous fixed and variable interest rate market enabling users to frictionlessly exchange the time value of their assets and complete the DeFi credit market.\n\nPlease note, **from April 22 through May 4**, Exactly will be undergoing a Public Audit. During this time, any in-scope bug submission reported to this program, that was also submitted for the contest, by one or more reporters, will be considered a 'Known Issue' and closed as out of scope. Additionally, valid bug reports submitted during the audit may have their rewards delayed until the audit is completed. A full list of reported known issues will be provided, and this program will be updated once the audit is completed.\n\nFor more information about Exactly, please visit [https://exact.ly/](https://exact.ly/).",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAudit Discoveries and Known Issues\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue (e.g., the use of deprecated Chainlink API was reported in [EXA-36](https://github.com/exactly/audits/blob/main/Coinspect%204th%20audit%20(Oct-22).pdf)), it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi.\n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at: [https://docs.exact.ly/security/audits](https://docs.exact.ly/security/audits).\n\nAll High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 20 000__. \n\nKYC is required for this bug bounty program. Government identification, legal name, and country of residence will need to be supplied.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Exactly__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC and DAI__, with the choice of the ratio at the team's discretion.",

However, only those in the Assets in Scope table are considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nThough only the proxy contracts are listed as in-scope, current implementation and any further updates to the implementation contracts are considered in scope. When reporting a bug, please make sure to select the relevant proxy smart contract as the target. \n\nIf an impact can be caused to any other asset managed by Exactly that isn’t on this table but for which the impact is in the Impacts in Scope section below, you are encouraged to submit it for consideration by the project. This only applies to Critical and High impacts.\n\nPeriphery Contracts have a reward cap equal to “High” (USD 25 000).
