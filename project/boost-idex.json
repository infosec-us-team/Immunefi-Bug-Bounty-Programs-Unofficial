IDEX's hybrid design combines an off-chain order book, matching and liquidation engine with on-chain custody and settlement. This approach blends the speed and efficiency of traditional trading systems with the transparency and security of blockchain technology to create an unparalleled trading experience.\n\nIDEX operates on XCHAIN, an IDEX specific Arbitrum Orbit layer 2. XCHAIN's performance supports gas free and nearly instant settlement of all IDEX transactions. Positions on IDEX are collateralized by USDC bridged into XCHAIN via Stargate's Hydra protocol.\n\nFor more information about IDEX please visit https://idex.io/ \n\nIDEX provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD.",

      "assetsBodyV2": "__Asset Accuracy Assurance__\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n__Private Known Issues Reward Policy__\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nIDEX commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that IDEX will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nIDEX adheres to the Primacy of Impact for all impacts.\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see Best Practices: Primacy of Impact \nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this boosted bug bounty and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, IDEX has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",
      "impactsBody": "__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.\n\n__Whitehat Educational Resources & Technical Info__\n\n- Documentation\n1) Smart Contracts: https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon \n2) API: https://api-docs-v4.idex.io/ \n- Technical education: Technical articles, ReadMe's, whitepaper, etc\n1) https://docs.idex.io/ \n\n__Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\nNo, it is a new system design.\n\n__What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?__\n\nIDEX supports a single whitelisted ERC20 token as collateral for deposits and withdrawals. Specifically, IDEX deposits and withdrawals are limited to Stargate v2 Hydra-wrapped USDC on XCHAIN.\n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\n\nStargate v2 and LayerZero v2 provide bridge support for depositing and withdrawing USDC. See ExchangeStargateV2Adapter.sol.\nPyth provides index and oracle pricing. See PythIndexPriceAdapter.sol and PythOraclePriceAdapter.sol.\n\n__Where might whitehats confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?__\n\nIDEX has multiple third party integrations and components including the Stargate/Layerzero protocol, Pyth oracle prices, and the Arbitrum Orbit layer 2 settlement network. IDEX specific components to support these integrations, e.g. the index price adapter contracts, are in scope, while any issues or exploits with the third party systems themselves (e.g. a bridge exploit) are out of scope.\n\n__Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse whitehats?__\n\nIDEX employs a hybrid design where the API, order books, and the matching engine operate off chain while smart contracts custody funds and verify operations. As a result, nearly all contract functionality is permissioned. Aside from standard owner and admin wallets, a designated dispatcher wallet, also operated by IDEX, is solely responsible for submitting trade settlements, liquidations, funding payments, etc. The use of a single dispatcher wallet guarantees the settlement sequence of off-chain actions within the contracts.\n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs?:__\n\nThere are a few key areas that deserve extra attention.\n\n_Unauthorized access to permissioned components_\n\n- Admin access (both onchain admin functions and offchain admin system access)\n- Upgrade mechanism exploits\n- Access to user wallet delegated key\n- Ability to place orders, cancel orders, or withdraw funds without wallet signature\n\n_Trading and smart contract rules violations_\n\n- Trade settlement violating the terms of the wallet-authorized orders\n- Margin requirement violations allowing wallets to exceed allowed leverage\n- Balance tracking errors leading to loss of funds\n\n__What is the test suite setup information?__\n\n- See the GitHub [README](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) for test suite operation.\n\n __Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- Issues resulting from index or oracle price manipulation.\n- Issues due to very low pricing.\n- Loss of unrealized profits during wallet [exit withdrawals](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon?tab=readme-ov-file#wallet-exits).\n- Loss of withdrawn value due to old oracle pricing during [exit withdrawals](https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon?tab=readme-ov-file#wallet-exits).\n- Issues related to the USDC proxy implementation being switched to something malicious.\n- EarningsEscrow.sol contract replay prevention mechanism only includes the contract’s address.\n- Behavior within the stated design intent as defined in documentation.\n- See the previously completed audits for identified issues.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nIDEX’s completed audit reports can be found at https://github.com/idexio/idex-contracts-ikon/tree/main/audits. \nAny unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n- 0xMacro A-1\n- 0xMacro B-1\n- PeckShield",
