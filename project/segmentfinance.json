      "programOverview": "Segment Finance, as a decentralized lending and borrowing platform on the BNB and opBNB Chains, extends its functionalities beyond the framework of the initial Compound Protocol fork. It offers not only the default lending-borrowing pool but also features isolated pools. These isolated pools are designed to offer specialized lending and borrowing services for a variety of assets, enhancing the platform's flexibility and appeal to a diverse user base.\n\nThe platform's architecture ensures that these isolated pools operate with distinct risk parameters, allowing for tailored risk management strategies. This design is particularly beneficial for assets with varying risk profiles, ensuring that each pool can maintain its stability and security independently of the others.\n\nFurthermore, Segment Finance integrates advanced smart contract functionalities to automate many of the processes involved in lending and borrowing. This includes automatic interest rate adjustments based on supply and demand dynamics, as well as innovative collateral management systems to protect lenders' assets.\n\nIn addition, Segment Finance seeks to innovate in the DeFi space by exploring cross-chain functionalities. This would potentially allow users to lend and borrow assets across different blockchain networks, significantly expanding the platform's utility and reach.\n\nFor more information about Segment Finance, please visit [https://www.segment.finance/.](https://www.segment.finance/)\n\nSegment Finance provides rewards in USDT, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nSegment Finance will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n- Full name;\n- Affiliated company (if any);\n- E-mail address.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nSegment Finance adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Smart Contract - Medium \n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nSegment Finance’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/verichains/public-audit-reports/blob/main/Verichains%20Public%20Audit%20Report%20-%20Segment%20Finance%20Pool%20Register%20-%20v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/verichains/public-audit-reports/blob/main/Verichains%20Public%20Audit%20Report%20-%20Segment%20Finance%20Pool%20Register%20-%20v1.0.pdf)\n\nAny unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Segment Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs on testnet assets, the reward is paid as a flat amount of USD 25 000. This is because there are no actual funds at risk on the testnet, hence limits objective calculation. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Segment Finance team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDT\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
