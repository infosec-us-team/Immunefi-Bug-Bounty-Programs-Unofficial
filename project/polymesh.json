It streamlines antiquated processes and opens the door to new financial instruments by solving the inherent challenges with public infrastructure around identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance.  \n\nFor more detailed information about Polymesh, you can visit their [website](https://polymesh.network/) or read their [whitepaper](https://info.polymesh.network/hubfs/Files/Polymesh-Whitepaper.pdf).   \n",

See \n\n  - [https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Polymesh/tree/develop/audit](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Polymesh/tree/develop/audit) \n\nPolymesh requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is a Name, Address, Phone Number, Email Address and Crypto Address (for \npayment of the award).\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Polymesh__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ or __POLYX__, at the discretion of the bug report submitter.\n",
