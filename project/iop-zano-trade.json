In the backend in-scope are all routes that can be called from /dex/ pages. All routes in provided backend files are also in-scope, as some of them can be called using API, not directly from frontend.\n\n\n__Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?__\n\n- No. It's a new web app in beta. \n\n__Where do you suspect there may be bugs and/or what attack vectors are you most concerned about?__\n\n- Most important potential vulnerabilities:\n1. Need to ensure database security as users' trade history is sensitive data. Make sure we don't expose it.\n2. Need to ensure user can't be tricked to sign unexpected ionic swap transaction (with different amount or assets from what is in their order)\n\n\n__What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported?__\n\n- Not Applicable, As it's based off confidential assets https://docs.zano.org/docs/build/confidential-assets/overview\n\n\n__What external dependencies are there?__\n\n- It's a standard next js app, so most external dependencies could be considered. \n\n\n__What are the most valuable educational resources already available?
