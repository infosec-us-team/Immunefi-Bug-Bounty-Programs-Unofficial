This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - In [https://github.com/artistic709/ImpermanentGain/blob/main/v2/IGainBase.sol](https://github.com/artistic709/ImpermanentGain/blob/main/v2/IGainBase.sol), on line 701, the transaction will fail if *reserveOut* is smaller than *amountIn*. This happens when you want to sell Long or Short with *burnA()* or *burnB()* and the liquidity is too small compared to the amount to be sold.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Hakka Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__, __USDC and ETH__, with the choice of the ratio at the discretion of the team.",
