      "programOverview": "__Program Overview__\n\nChainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform. It has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, on-chain finance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink empowers developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.\n\nLearn more about Chainlink by visiting [chain.link](https://chain.link/) or reading the developer documentation at [docs.chain.link](https://docs.chain.link/). To discuss an integration, [reach out to an expert](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/to/OYQO67EF?page=announcement&typeform-source=www.google.com).\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nChainlink adheres to the Primacy of Impact, meaning that if you believe you have found a bug that causes an “In-scope Impact”, even if the affected system is not strictly within the assets listed, we still encourage you to submit it to the program for consideration. Chainlink adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n- Smart Contract - High\n- Websites and Applications - Critical\n- Websites and Applications - High",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.  \n\nAll Smart Contracts bug reports require a proof of concept (PoC) and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. All Websites and Applications bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset in scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoCs and code is required.\n\nRewards for Critical Smart Contract vulnerabilities are at the sole and exclusive discretion of Chainlink Labs, with maximum reward of USD $3,000,000.\n\nSpecific reward amounts are determined based on a number of factors, such as the impact of proposed issues, ease of exploitability, and how likely the exploit conditions might occur.\n\nAny supplementary reward beyond the minimum for the assigned criticality rating is at the discretion of Chainlink Labs.\n\n__KYC requirement__\n\nTo ensure compliance, Chainlink Labs requires Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information to be provided for all bug bounty reporters submitting a report and requesting a reward. \n\nThe information required:\n\n  - Color copy of passport\n    - Full Legal Name (First, middle, and last, plus any prefix, and/or suffix)\n\n  - Proof of current address (either a redacted bank statement with your address or a recent utility bill with your name, address, and issuer of the bill)\n\n  - If you are a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, partnership, LLC, corporation, estate or trust, please send a filled-out and signed W-9 ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf))\n\n  - If you are not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, please send a filled-out and signed W-8BEN for individual and W-8 BEN-E for entities ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf); [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8bene.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8bene.pdf)), and provide statement to certify that all services are performed outside of the U.S. \n\n  - Ethereum Wallet Address (for transfer of payment)\n\nAll bug bounty reporters must pass the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List (SDN) list screening. Rewards cannot be paid out if reporters are on the OFAC SDN list.\n\nThe collection and review of this information will be handled by the __Chainlink Labs__ team directly.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Chainlink Labs__ team directly, denominated in __USD__, and sent in __Ethereum (ETH)__ or __USD Coin (USDC)__.\n\n\n__Repeatable Attacks__\n\nIn the event a report applies to multiple contracts or can be triggered multiple times, if a contract or product can be paused (either through on or off-chain means) only the impact of the first usage will be considered. If a product is not pausable such that there is no realistic way to prevent repeated usage of the attack, the entire amount at risk will be considered when evaluating impact.",
