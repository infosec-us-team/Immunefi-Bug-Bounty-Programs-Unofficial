      "programOverview": "Chainlink is the industry standard for building, accessing, and selling oracle services needed to power hybrid smart contracts on any blockchain. Chainlink oracle networks provide smart contracts with a way to\nreliably connect to any external API and leverage secure off-chain computations for enabling feature-rich applications. Chainlink currently secures tens of billions of dollars across DeFi, insurance, gaming, and\nother major industries, and offers global enterprises and leading data providers a universal gateway to all Blockchains.\n\nLearn more about Chainlink by visiting [chain.link](https://chain.link/) or reading the developer documentation at [docs.chain.link](https://docs.chain.link/). To discuss an integration, [reach out to an expert](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/to/OYQO67EF?page=announcement&typeform-source=www.google.com).\n\nUnlike other bug bounty programs on Immunefi, all bug report submissions, including associated vulnerabilities, become the exclusive property of Chainlink Labs. By making a submission to this program and in consideration for a bounty, the bug submitter conveys all ownership rights, titles, and interests in the bug report to Chainlink Labs. Thus, the final decision on whether a postmortem will be written is at the sole discretion of Chainlink Labs.\n\nBy submitting a bug report, you agree to refrain from any public disclosure of the report and associated vulnerability unless explicit written consent is provided in advance by the Chainlink team.\n\nUse testnet oracles: [https://docs.chain.link/docs/any-api/testnet-oracles/#:~:text=test](https://docs.chain.link/docs/any-api/testnet-oracles/#:~:text=test) \n\nInstructions to setup your node: [https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/#:~:text=node ](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/#:~:text=node)\n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.  \n\nAll Smart Contracts bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. All Websites and Applications bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as\nPoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for “Critical” Smart Contract vulnerabilities are at the sole and exclusive discretion of Chainlink Labs, with a minimum reward of __USD $100,000__ and maximum reward of __USD $3,000,000__. Determination of the final reward amount may take into consideration, but is not limited to, the following factors: funds at risk, as well as public relations and branding aspects.\n\n__KYC requirement__\n\nTo ensure compliance with applicable law, Chainlink Labs requires Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information to be provided for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and requesting a reward. \n\nThe information required:\n  - Full Legal Name (First, middle and last, plus any prefix, and/or suffix)\n  - City and Country of Residence\n  - Country of Citizenship\n  - Ethereum Wallet Address (for transfer of payment)\n\nThe collection and review of this information will be handled by the __Chainlink Labs__ team directly.\n\nPayouts are handled by the Chainlink Labs team directly, denominated in __USD, and sent in Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), or Tether (USDT)__.",
