It aims to do this by pioneering innovative Web3 user experiences in a trustless, non-custodial, and decentralized manner. Composable's technology stack enables and combines key services across different DeFi ecosystems and protocols, such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, and NEAR. \n\nWith their products, Composable Finance intends to reduce these barriers that DeFi developers and users face.\n\nFor more information about Composable Finance, please check out their website at [https://www.composable.finance/](https://www.composable.finance/) and their docs at [https://docs.composable.finance/](https://docs.composable.finance/). \n",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll Critical and High Blockchain/DLT bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nReward maximums vary case-by-case with direct regard to the impact of the threat presented and scoped as determined by Composable Finance personnel. Composable Finance offers varying guaranteed minimum payouts for all levels of vulnerabilities with an accompanying PoC. Reward maximums will not exceed __$500,000__. \n\nComposable Finance requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed are 2 forms of Photo Identification and Proof of Address. The collection of this information will be done by the project team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Composable Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.",
