      "programOverview": "Omron, the next stage in cryptographically verified efficient and intelligent networks. By leveraging incentive design, Omron optimizes the generation of zero knowledge and verified compute across verticals such as zkML, zkRollups, training, model distillation and much more.\n\nOmron serves as a dynamic hub, connecting users to specialized services within Bittensor subnets. Enabling access to diverse offerings like data, computational tasks,  and complex analyses, while Omron ensures the origins of AI outputs are cryptographically verified through zero-knowledge proofs with Proof-of-Inference.\n\nOmron’s computational integrity is reinforced through the use of a Proof-of-Inference mechanism. A protocol which leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs to verify proper computation of AI models and their resulting inference. Providing not only peace of mind and protection from malicious or malfunctioning AI, but also providing the ability for external networks, smart contracts, and AI Agents to automatically accept output results at face value due to this improved security, adding a new level of efficiency.\n\nFor more information about Omron, please visit [https://omron.ai/](https://omron.ai/)\n\n**Inference Labs** provides rewards in **USDC** or **USDT** on **Ethereum**, denominated in **USD**. Inference Labs shall have full access and control over its Immunefi vault (the \"Vault\"), in which Inference Labs will deposit **USDC** and/or **USDT** to pay rewards, and the assets in the Vault (the “Assets”). For the avoidance of doubt, Inference Labs shall have full discretion to withdraw the Assets from the Vault at any time. \n\nFor more details about the payment process, please view the __Rewards by Threat Level__ section.\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nInference Labs will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill) within the past three (3) months)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued identification document\n- Eligibility Criteria \n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nInference Labs adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nInference Labs commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Inference Labs will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nInference Labs’ completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/inference-labs-inc/omron-contracts/blob/main/audits/Zellic.pdf](https://github.com/inference-labs-inc/omron-contracts/blob/main/audits/Zellic.pdf) and [https://github.com/inference-labs-inc/omron-contracts/blob/main/audits/Testmachine.pdf](https://github.com/inference-labs-inc/omron-contracts/blob/main/audits/Testmachine.pdf). Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Inference Labs has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within the Program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the Project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the Project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the Project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 25 000 to USD 50 000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional [24h] that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a maximum cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the Project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\nFor critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with USD 15 000, only if the impact leads to:\n\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of __USD 11 000__. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the __Impact in Scope__ table.  \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nThe Inference Labs team shall handle payment of the rewards. Rewards will be denominated in USD, but will be paid in USDC or USDT on Ethereum. The Inference Labs team shall have full discretion over the payment date and payment method in respect of the rewards.",
