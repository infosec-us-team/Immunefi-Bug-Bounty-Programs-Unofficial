Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, all bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix to be considered for a reward. \n\nPrior to the official launch of SuperBots, this bug bounty program will also have a hard cap of __USD 25 000__. In the event that multiple bug reports are submitted that exceed this amount, the rewards will be provided on a first come first served basis. This program will be taken down once all __USD 25 000__ of rewards have been paid out.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __SuperBots__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__.\n\nAny issues identified in the following audit report are considered known, and ineligible for reward: [https://www.certik.com/projects/superbots](https://www.certik.com/projects/superbots)",
