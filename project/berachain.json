      "programOverview": "Berachain is a high-performance EVM-Identical Layer 1 (L1) blockchain utilizing Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) as a consensus mechanism and built on top of a modular EVM-focused consensus client framework named BeaconKit.\n\nBeaconKit is a modular framework for building EVM-based consensus clients. The framework offers the most user-friendly way to build and operate an EVM blockchain while ensuring a functionally identical execution environment to the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nFor more information about Berachain, please visit our [docs](https://docs.berachain.com/) or our [code](https://github.com/berachain).\n\nBerachain provides rewards in BERA on Berachain, denominated in USD. Please see the **Rewards by Threat Level** section for more details about the payment process. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nBerachain will be requesting KYC information to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with the address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government ID\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement outlined in this program and cannot be:\n\n- On OFAC SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors who directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nBerachain adheres to category 3 - Approval Required. This Policy determines what information researchers can make public from their submitted bug reports. For more details on the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\nBerachain adheres to the Primacy of Rules, meaning the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated on this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC demonstrating the bug's impact is required for this program and must comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit/issues\n- https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit/pulls\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\n- https://github.com/berachain/security-audits\n\n**Current known issues related to the [Berachain Airdrops Contract](https://github.com/berachain/airdrop-contracts) are presented in the following audit reports:**\n- https://github.com/berachain/security-audits/blob/main/20250131-Airdrop-Zenith.pdf\n- https://github.com/berachain/security-audits/blob/main/20250205-Airdrop-Cantina.pdf\n- https://github.com/berachain/security-audits/blob/main/20241223-Airdrop-Zellic.pdf\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may receive valid reports (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the bug's impact, which are not viable or would require unconventional action.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) that, by default, state what security researchers and projects can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Berachain has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).\n\nIf you are interested in exploring **Berachain (Web/Apps)**, check out our **Websites and Applications** bug bounty program here: https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/berachain-webapps/information/",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Vulnerabilites are prioritised according to impact and/or severity.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward of $250,000. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000 is to be rewarded to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $250,000. Calculating the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000 is to be rewarded to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n\n- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. The project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High-Level Reports__\n\n- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within $10,000 to $50,000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.\n\n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for more significant damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures more substantial incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n \n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Berachain team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are made in BERA on Berachain.\n\nThe net amount rewarded is calculated based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",

      "defaultFeasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
