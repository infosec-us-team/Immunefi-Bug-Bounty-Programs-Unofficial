  "programOverview": "Katana is a chain designed specifically for DeFi. It rethinks DeFi to offer what users care about most: deeper liquidity and higher yields, all in a sustainable way. This happens through mechanisms to ensure that all liquidity on Katana is absorbed in only one lending protocol (Morpho), one spot DEX (Sushi), which are the core applications on Katana with hundreds of applications building on top of them. This is achieved with a unique approach to maximizing yield that can be used as incentives on the core applications, including from Vault Bridge, sequencer fees, and Agora USD revenue.\n\nKatana has deeply embedded, user-focused interoperability, using Agglayer for all users to onboard seamlessly. Katana uses ZK proofs to validate state transitions, allowing users to exit the chain without long wait periods.\n\nFor more information about Katana, please visit [https://katana.network/](https://katana.network/)\n\nKatana provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nKatana adheres to **Category 3: Approval Required**. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nKatana adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract  —  Critical\n- Smart Contract  —  High\n- Smart Contract  —  Medium\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nKatana’s completed audit reports can be found here:\n\n- [https://github.com/katana-network/kat-token/tree/main/audit](https://github.com/katana-network/kat-token/tree/main/audit)\n- [https://github.com/agglayer/vault-bridge/tree/v1.0.0/audit](https://github.com/agglayer/vault-bridge/tree/v1.0.0/audit)\n- [https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults-v3/tree/master/audits](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults-v3/tree/master/audits)\n- [https://github.com/agglayer/lxly-bridge-and-call/tree/main/audit](https://github.com/agglayer/lxly-bridge-and-call/tree/main/audit)\n- [https://github.com/agglayer/ulxly-contracts/tree/develop/audits](https://github.com/agglayer/ulxly-contracts/tree/develop/audits)\n\nAny unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",

  "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of **USD 80 000**. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of **USD 20 000** is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. \n- The amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at **100%** and then a reduction of **25%** from the amount of the first attack for every **[300 blocks]** the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of **USD 3 000 to USD 15 000** with the reward calculated based on **100%** of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Katana team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
