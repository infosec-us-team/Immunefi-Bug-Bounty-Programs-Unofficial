  "programOverview": "Welcome to the Aleo Bug Bounty Program! We care deeply about the security of the Aleo network and want to incentivize white hat hackers and security researchers to find vulnerabilities in our core protocol.\n\nAleo is a developer platform that uses zero-knowledge technology to enable decentralized apps that are private, programmable, secure, and scalable. We are launching a fully permissionless, next-generation blockchain & new consensus protocol that is faster, more efficient, and more decentralized than traditional models. Aleo is more than a blockchain. It’s a new computing paradigm defined by client-side execution & cutting-edge cryptography designed for the web.\n\nFor more information about Aleo, please visit [https://aleo.org/](https://aleo.org/).\n\nAleo provides rewards in **ALEO** on **Aleo Network**, denominated in **USD**. For more details about the payment process, please view the **Rewards by Threat Level** section.\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nAleo will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nAleo adheres to **Category 3: Approval Required**. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAleo adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAleo’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://aleo.org/post/aleo-completes-security-audits-of-snarkos-and-snarkvm/](https://aleo.org/post/aleo-completes-security-audits-of-snarkos-and-snarkvm/). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.",

  "rewardsBody": "__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor Critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward USD 65 000. However, a minimum reward of USD 10 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown): USD 25 000\n- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork): USD 25 000\n- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork): USD 10 000 - USD 25 000\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor High Blockchain/DLT non-funds-at risk impacts, the reward will be paid out as follows: \n\n- Unintended chain split (network partition): USD 10 000\n- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments: USD 10 000\n- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters: USD 10 000\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Aleo team directly and are denominated in **USD**. However, payments are done in **ALEO** on **Aleo Network**.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability",
