  "assetsBodyV2": "__Asset Accuracy Assurance__\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n__Private Known Issues Reward Policy__\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward equal to that of a bug one severity lower.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nShardeum commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Shardeum will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nShardeum adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this audit competition and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Shardeum has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

The size depends on the bugs found:\n* If one or more Critical severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 100% of the respective reward pool, $100,000 USD**\n* If one or more High severity bugs are found, the **reward pool will be 75% of the respective reward pool, $75,000 USD** \n* If one or more Medium severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 50% of the respective reward pool, $50,000 USD**\n* Otherwise, the reward pool will be **25% of the respective reward pool, $25,000 USD**\n\nFor this Audit Competition, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward. \n\nPrivate known issues will unlock higher reward pools according to their severity level without any downgrade. For example, a Critical severity bug which was a private known issue would unlock the reward pool conditional on a Critical severity bug being found.\n\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/) \n\n**Duplicates of Insight reports are not eligible for a reward.** \n\n**Reward Payment Terms**\nPayouts are handled by the Shardeum team directly and are denominated in USD.

Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report.

Archivers will not be public at launch\nPriv escalation in RPC\nLoss of data integrity on archive/RPC servers  Ex: changing receipts\n**Which part(s) of the system do you want whitehats to attempt to break the most?**\nArchiver and RPC server. We want them to break all of it obviously but we believe these two components need more attention\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nThings listed in package.json\n\n**Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\nThe default config in the branch is in scope. Whitehats are free to configure, patch, and modify their own malicious hosts however they want. However, target service must be running the default config in the target branch running in production mode. Vulns involving a service attacking itself are not in scope. This is to prevent the whitehats from wasting time reporting things we specifically allow in debug mode. If the researchers can enable debug mode options remotely then that is valid and can be paid out.\nAttacks that require the attacker to own an archive server will have their severity reduced to insight by default, but may be raised at the project’s discretion.\nAttacks that require the network to still be initializing/bootstrapping are out of scope. Wait until the network mode reaches “processing” + 15 cycles after startup before launching attacks. The rules for staking/join are a little different and the network will not be public during this time. Attacks on a network that is repairing itself (was once in “processing” mode but has since degraded to “safety” or “recovery”) are in scope.\nAttacks that require lots of network traffic, large messages, or many connections will be given an severity of “insight”. The project may increase this at our discretion.\n0day vulnerabilities in dependencies will have a max impact of insight. Any other vuln in dependencies is out of scope.\nAny report based on unit tests, simulations, or anything not a fully functioning service, will have a max impact of low.\nSmart contracts and smart contract related code/functions are out of scope\nFinally, the more nodes that are required to launch an attack, the more at risk the vuln is of being downgraded. If it takes 33% (for example) of the nodes in the network being malicious to cause damage, then it becomes difficult to distinguish the impact from a brute-force/51% attack, which is completely out of scope.\n\n**Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?**\n\nThe archive server is designed to store the history of the network. Archivers are not a part of the core protocol, do not have any part in consensus, and do not affect joining/rotation. Another quirk is that currently, the transaction history is not chained. The cycle certificates are chained which contains information like joined and lost nodes per cycle, active nodes, archiver list, standby list, etc. The transaction history will have a Merkle root published while the chaining is developed.",
