If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nNo, it’s a new Mellow project\n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs?**\n\nMost important parts: SimpleDVTStakingStrategy and deposit and withdraw flows, ACLs and ManagedValidator. \nInvariants: LP token price in ETH is strictly not decreasing.\n\n**What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?**\n\nDeposit and withdrawals support only ERC20 tokens. System internally can use rebasing tokens such as stETH. \nTokens used: wstETH, stETH and wETH \n\n**What emergency actions may you want to use as a reason to invalidate or downgrade an otherwise valid bug report?**\n\nPossible actions:\nDisable deposits (Enable deposit locks)\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nTrusted actors:\n- VaultAdmin: 0x9437B2a8cF3b69D782a61f9814baAbc172f72003 (Lido+Mellow multisig)\n- ProxyVaultAdmin: 0x81698f87C6482bF1ce9bFcfC0F103C4A0Adf0Af0 (Lido+Mellow multisig (ProxyVaultAdmin can change the vault implementation.)\n- CuratorAdmin: 0x2E93913A796a6C6b2bB76F41690E78a2E206Be54 (Steakhouse multisig)\n- CuratorOperator: 0x2afc096981c2CFe3501bE4054160048718F6C0C8 (Steakhouse EOA)\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nTrusted actors:\n- VaultAdmin: 0x9437B2a8cF3b69D782a61f9814baAbc172f72003, (Lido+Mellow multisig)\n- ProxyVaultAdmin: 0x81698f87C6482bF1ce9bFcfC0F103C4A0Adf0Af0 (Lido+Mellow multisig (ProxyVaultAdmin can change the vault implementation.))\n- CuratorAdmin: 0x2E93913A796a6C6b2bB76F41690E78a2E206Be54 (Steakhouse multisig)\n- CuratorOperator: 0x2afc096981c2CFe3501bE4054160048718F6C0C8 (Steakhouse EOA)\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nOpen Zeppelin 5.0.2, Lido\n\n**Where might whitehats confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\nLido contracts\n\n**Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse whitehats?**\n\nIn emergency withdrawal we calculate amounts based on ERC20 balances of tokens and not based on baseTvl function (Vault) return values\n\n**Which chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed to?**\n\nEthereum Mainnet \nDocs: [https://docs.mellow.finance/mellow-lrt-lst-primitive/contract-deployments#dvsteth-vault](https://docs.mellow.finance/mellow-lrt-lst-primitive/contract-deployments#dvsteth-vault)\n\n**What is the test suite setup information?**\n\n[https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/tree/fixes/audit-sherlock-fixes/tests/obol](https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/tree/fixes/audit-sherlock-fixes/tests/obol)\n\n**Public Disclosure of Known Issues**\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n- From Sherlock contest:\n      - We consider the price of 1 steth == 1 eth.\n      - In emergencyWithdraw, we process withdrawals not through the values from baseTvl but through regular ERC20 balances (this is a design decision).\n      - In the SimpleDVTStakingStrategy, the convertAndDeposit function can be front-run by anyone.\n\n- From ChainSecurity:\n      - The StakingModule may not deposit into the Simple DVT module (due to MinFirstAllocationStrategy in Lido).\n      - Emergency withdrawal (the same second point from Sherlock).\n      - All updates of important parameters can be front-run (this is 5.6 from ChainSecurity).\n\n**Previous Audits**\n\nMellow’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/tree/fixes/audit-sherlock-fixes/audits](https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/tree/fixes/audit-sherlock-fixes/audits). Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Asset In Scope Policies__\n\n**Asset Accuracy Assurance**\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n**Private Known Issues Reward Policy**\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward.\n\n**Known Issue Assurance**\n\nLido commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Lido will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n**Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules**\n\nLido adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page.",

The size depends on the bugs found:\n- If one or more Critical severity bugs are found the reward pool will be - $100,000 USD\n- If one or more High severity bugs are found the reward pool will be - $75,000 USD\n- If one or more Medium severity bugs is found the reward pool will be - $20,000 USD\n\nFor this Audit Competition, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward. \n\nPrivate known issues will unlock higher reward pools as though they were one severity level lower. For example, a Critical severity bug which was a private known issue would unlock the reward pool conditional on a High severity bug being found.\n\nThe severity level of private known issues remains unchanged and whitehats earn their portion of the reward pool and position on the leaderboard according to this unchanged severity level.\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/).\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Lido team directly and are denominated in USD.

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Ionic has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",
