      "programOverview": "Revert develops analytics and management tools for liquidity providers in AMM protocols. \n\nRevert Compoundor protocol allows for the automation through awarding executors (compoundors) a small fee to compensate for their gas costs, and a simple mechanism that incentivizes the compounding of positions as close to optimal as possible.\n\nFor more information about Revert, please visit [https://revert.finance/](https://revert.finance/).",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nCritical/High severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Critical/High severity bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix to be considered for a reward. \n\nPrior to the official launch of Revert, this bug bounty program will also have a hard cap of __USD 30 000__. In the event that multiple bug reports are submitted that exceed this amount, the rewards will be provided on a first come first served basis. This program will be taken down once all __USD 30 000__ of rewards have been paid out.\n\nThe following known issues are considered to be out of scope of this program: \n  - Calling the autoCompound() function can be frontrun by MEV txs and recommend using flashbots for anyone who wants to do auto-compounding / build an auto-compounder bot.\n  - The function which swaps the two tokens into ratio to be added as liquidity is not 100% accurate (because of slippage, bonus calculation) but should always add the majority of the available tokens as liquidity to the position - and the remaining tokens MUST be added to the internal token balances.\n  - The protocol is not intended to work with any kind of deflationary, rebasing, fee-on-transfer, or any non-standard erc20 behavior tokens.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Revert__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__. ",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n  - Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n  - Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__\n  - Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n    - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n  - Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n  - Lack of liquidity\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Sybil attacks\n  - Centralization risks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n  - Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n  - Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n  - Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n  - Any denial of service attacks\n  - Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n  - Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",
