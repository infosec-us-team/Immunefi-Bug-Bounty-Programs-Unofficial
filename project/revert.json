      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nCritical/High severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Critical/High severity bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix to be considered for a reward. \n\nPrior to the official launch of Revert, this bug bounty program will also have a hard cap of __USD 30 000__. In the event that multiple bug reports are submitted that exceed this amount, the rewards will be provided on a first come first served basis. This program will be taken down once all __USD 30 000__ of rewards have been paid out.\n\nThe following known issues are considered to be out of scope of this program: \n  - Calling the autoCompound() function can be frontrun by MEV txs and recommend using flashbots for anyone who wants to do auto-compounding / build an auto-compounder bot.\n  - The function which swaps the two tokens into ratio to be added as liquidity is not 100% accurate (because of slippage, bonus calculation) but should always add the majority of the available tokens as liquidity to the position - and the remaining tokens MUST be added to the internal token balances.\n  - The protocol is not intended to work with any kind of deflationary, rebasing, fee-on-transfer, or any non-standard erc20 behavior tokens.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Revert__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__. ",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
