      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nCritical/High severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Critical/High severity bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix to be considered for a reward. \n\nPrior to the official launch of Revert, this bug bounty program will also have a hard cap of __USD 30 000__. In the event that multiple bug reports are submitted that exceed this amount, the rewards will be provided on a first come first served basis. This program will be taken down once all __USD 30 000__ of rewards have been paid out.\n\nThe following known issues are considered to be out of scope of this program: \n  - Calling the autoCompound() function can be frontrun by MEV txs and recommend using flashbots for anyone who wants to do auto-compounding / build an auto-compounder bot.\n  - The function which swaps the two tokens into ratio to be added as liquidity is not 100% accurate (because of slippage, bonus calculation) but should always add the majority of the available tokens as liquidity to the position - and the remaining tokens MUST be added to the internal token balances.\n  - The protocol is not intended to work with any kind of deflationary, rebasing, fee-on-transfer, or any non-standard erc20 behavior tokens.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Revert__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.",
