Hermetica builds open, durable financial infrastructure designed to operate globally and at scale, empowering individuals with resilient financial tools in their pursuit of financial freedom.\n\nThere’s one product in scope for the program: hBTC, a Bitcoin yield vault written in Clarity with ERC-4626–style share mint/redeem, daily NAV updates, and strategy execution via external protocol integrations.\n\nFor more information about Hermetica, please visit [https://docs.hermetica.fi/](https://docs.hermetica.fi/)\n\nHermetica provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nHermetica adheres to  Category 3: Approval Required . This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our Responsible Publication page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nHermetica adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Smart Contract  —  Critical\n- Smart Contract  —  High\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the I[mmunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nHermetica’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://docs.hermetica.fi/hbtc/audits](https://docs.hermetica.fi/hbtc/audits). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.",

  "rewardsBody": "__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 20 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\nFor critical web/apps bugs, reports will be rewarded with USD 25 000, only if the impact leads to:\n- A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n- Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of USD 5 000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.  \n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward\n- The amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at **100%** and then a reduction of **25%** from the amount of the first attack for every **[300 blocks]** the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down.\n\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of **USD 1 000 to USD 20 000** depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Hermetica team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
