Today it offers two key\nproducts: Bridge Protocol, an open-source ERC20 asset tokenization platform\nwith related tech, financial, legal and compliance services, as well as Bridge\nWallet, a non-custodial Bitcoin and Ethereum mobile wallet with live\ncrypto-fiat on/off-ramp.\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts, mobile apps and\nwebsite, and is mostly aimed at addressing serious security issues directly\naffecting fund safety and user data protection.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAdditionally, all bug reports without proof of concept exploits with\ndemonstrated impact, as well as recommendations for new features, are not\naccepted.\n\nPayouts are handled by **Mt Pelerin** directly and are estimated in\n**USD**. However, payouts are done in **ETH, BTC, USDT, USDC, or DAI**.",
