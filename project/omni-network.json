      "programOverview": "Omni is the abstraction layer for the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing developers to access all the users and liquidity across rollups without upgrading their contracts. With Omni, using Ethereum and all its rollup feels like a singular chain — no bridging, switching RPCs, or gas management. Omni achieves this through coordinating a network of solvers who handle all cross platform complexities.\n\nOmni’s V1 release in scope for this competition consists of 2 primary building blocks: xchain messaging and the Omni EVM. These building blocks are supported by 3 components that make up the Omni’s core network architecture:\n- Smart contracts on supported chains\n- Cosmos sdk client (halo) which acts as our consensus client for xchain messaging and for the EVM\n- Vanilla geth as the EVM execution client\n\nFor more information about Omni, please visit https://omni.network/.",

      "rewardsBody": "## Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected, capped at the maximum critical reward $25,000.\n\nHowever, a minimum reward of USD $10,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding on a bug report.\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs with a non-funds-at risk impact, the reward will be paid out as follows:\n\n> Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown) - $50,000 USD\n> Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires governance proposal) - $50,000 USD\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $25,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $10,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\nFor critical web/apps bugs, reports will be rewarded with $10,000, only if the impact leads to:\n\n> A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action\n> Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds\n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of $5,000. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.\n\nIf a vulnerability is reported for a malicious validator action, the severity will be Low.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of $5,000 to $10,000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\nFor critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward.",

      "description": "Omni is the abstraction layer for the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing developers to access all the users and liquidity across rollups without upgrading their contracts. With Omni, using Ethereum and all its rollup feels like a singular chain — no bridging, switching RPCs, or gas management. Omni achieves this through coordinating a network of solvers who handle all cross platform complexities.",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
