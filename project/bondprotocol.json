This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required..\n\nKnown Issues highlighted in their previous audit reports are considered out of scope:\n\n- [https://github.com/Bond-Protocol/bond-contracts/tree/master/audits](https://github.com/Bond-Protocol/bond-contracts/tree/master/audits)\n\nBond Protocol requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is name and address.  If a hunter prefers to stay anonymous, one would need to sign an NDA provided by Bond Protocol’s legal counsel. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Bond Protocol__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
