Clusters are smart contracts that manage a dynamic investment strategy.\n\nThese clusters possess two main unique properties:\n\n__Programmable, updates for target weight allocation__\n\nAs opposed to its TradFi counterparts which are seldom managed and adjusted through rigid parameters, Clusters can quickly adjust their target allocations as frequently as every block, to actively steer their inventory composition to stay course or pivot according to their designed strategy. There are no inherent restrictions on the possible logic used or the assets included, and thus no limitations to what strategies the cluster can follow\n\n__Decentralized, continuous rebalancing__\n\nWhereas traditional structured products are periodically balanced by a centralized entity, clusters are continuously and organically kept in balance with their target through the activity and actions of the users of the protocol themselves. Clusters need no active management and are powered from the organic activity of Nebula users.\n\nFor more information about Nebula Protocol, please visit [https://docs.neb.money/](https://docs.neb.money/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Any governance voting result manipulation\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nThe following known issue is considered as out of scope of this program.\n\nAn actor could utilize the current governance snapshot feature to enable polls to reach quorum slightly more easily by:\n  - waiting until the poll is snapshotted\n  - staking a large amount of NEB tokens in governance\n  - vote on the poll\n\nHowever:\n  - even without this snapshot implementation, actors could still manipulate quorum by staking/unstaking right before the poll ends to have different quorum calculation\n  - the difference is that without the snapshot feature they could do it right at the end if they do not like the outcome of the poll\n  - the snapshot feature is implemented to prevent whales denying reaching quorum\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of mainnet economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Nebula Protocol__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __UST__.",
