      "programOverview": "Sovryn is an on-chain decentralized trading and lending protocol deployed on RSK, a side chain of the Bitcoin blockchain-powered by merge-mining, and is governed by the community. The Sovryn protocol is controlled by its community and stakeholders. There is no single company, organization, or individual that represents or controls the Sovryn protocol. While the Sovryn community is built on the principles of transparency, the Sovryn protocol's decentralized structure means that there is no single party that can be relied upon to provide you with accurate information. \n\nThe SOV token is used to tokenize the rights, rewards, and risks associated with participating in Sovryn Bitocracy. It is used to represent voting power and to wrap the rewards and risks of Sovryn's future into a digital representation. SOV can be used by the Sovryn protocol whenever there is a need to balance risks and rewards. Changes to the protocol introduce risks, but if they are successful, can grow the use of the protocol and the fee revenue it generates. SOV can be staked to cover user losses and thus insure that they do not occur. \n\nThe Sovryn bug bounty program was initially submitted as [Sovryn Improvement Proposal 8](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/SIPS/blob/main/SIP-0008.md) and was [approved on February 26 with 100% consensus](https://twitter.com/SovrynBTC/status/1365431235217096704?s=20). It is focused around its smart contracts and the prevention of loss of user funds. \nFor more information about Sovryn, please visit [https://www.sovryn.app/](https://www.sovryn.app/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Any governance voting result manipulation\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Taking Down the application/website\n  - Redirection of user deposits and withdrawals\n  - Subdomain takeover resulting in financial loss",

In addition, Critical and High severity reports must come with a suggestion for a fix to be considered for a reward.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract and blockchain/DLT vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports. \n\nFor Blockchain/DLT infrastructure, only vulnerabilities that result in direct economic damage to yield will be considered as __High__, and only vulnerabilities that result in direct economic damage to principal funds will be considered as __Critical__.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Sovryn__ team directly and are denominated in USD. 50% of the payouts are done in __BTC__, and the other 50% is paid out in __SOV__ according to a 24 month vesting schedule (with monthly vesting).\n\n| __Blockchain/DLT__     | __Payout__     |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| __Critical__       | Up to USD $1,000,000       |\n| __High__       | USD $22,140       |\n",

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
