  "programOverview": "Thala is a suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives serving as the backbone of the Aptos ecosystem. The protocol revolves around three modules: AMM, CDP, and LST. \n\nFor more information about Thala Protocol, please visit https://www.thalalabs.xyz/.\n\nThala Protocol provides rewards in USDC on Aptos, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n## Closed Source BBP\n\nThis program is designed for security researchers to review the project’s system from a black-box perspective. Researchers will perform penetration testing on local copies of the blockchain without access to the source code. \n\nThe project will provide a dedicated testing framework where all Proofs of Concept (PoCs) must be written and executed. Submitting a valid PoC is required to be eligible for rewards. PoCs will be tested by the project and, if applicable, by the triage team (in the case of managed triaging) or during mediation. This process ensures verification of reported bugs and confirmation that the claimed impact can indeed be achieved.\n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThala Protocol will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__ \n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- A contracted technical contributor who is being directly compensated by the project or directly compensated by a contracted organization providing technical services to the project.\n- A former contracted technical contributor who, for the past year from the date of the bug report submission, was directly compensated by the project or was compensated by a contracted organization to the project. In the case of the latter, the status of the organization’s contract with the project is irrelevant.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nThala Protocol adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract  —  Critical\n- Smart Contract  —  High\n- Smart Contract  —  Medium\n- Smart Contract  —  Low\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. \n\nFor more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact) \n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the rules below.\n- All Proofs of Concept must be implemented using the [AptosBB framework](https://github.com/otter-sec/aptosbb). Submissions relying on alternative tools, scripts, or methods shall be deemed invalid and will not be accepted.\n- Researchers must clone the AptosBB repository, clear the contents of the pentest.rs file, and implement their PoC therein. The PoC must demonstrate the exploit in an isolated, local environment, consistent with the framework’s intended design\n- Manual alteration of the WriteSet, or any modification of behaviors not reproducible on the target system in a remote execution scenario, is strictly prohibited. Any such modifications shall render the submission void.\n- All submitted PoCs must replicate an end-to-end exploit against the target contract and clearly demonstrate the security impact. Submissions that fail to show demonstrable, reproducible impact shall not qualify for reward consideration.",

  "rewardsBody": "__Rewards by Threat Level__\n\nReward Calculation for Critical Level Reports\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $250,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\n- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward.\n  - In the case of unverified smart contracts, the proof about such functionality will be checked during a mediation by a Triage team.\n- The amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the impact of the first attack being at 100% and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 34,000 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down.\n\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of $10,000 to $25,000 with the reward calculated based on 100% of the funds at risk, though capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward.\n\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Thala Protocol team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Aptos.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
