This makes for an extremely fast, secure, easy-to-use and gas efficient solution.\n\nMagpie Protocol incorporates a unique technical implementation that allows execution of cross-chain swaps without the need for the user to bridge any assets themselves. This saves time and cost by reducing both the complexity and security risks involved in using current bridging solutions to move assets across chains.\n\nFor more information about Magpie Protocol, please visit [https://www.magpiefi.xyz/ ](https://www.magpiefi.xyz/)\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template) \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nMagpie Protocol adheres to category 2.

However, payouts are done in USDC and USDT. Magpie Protocol commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a Primacy of Impact program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements__\n\nMagpie Protocol does have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts. \n\nKYC Info Required:\n- [Magpie.synaps.me](http://magpie.synaps.me/) \n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at: \n- [SmartContract_Audit_MagpieProtocol(v2)_v1.0 (2).pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OfyARNQ3y05X6VmE4p_5vIDcdoORLLjx/view?usp=sharing)\n\nDescription of known issue\n- SAME CONTRACT/LIBRARY NAMES\n- ARRAY LENGTH CACHING\n- CODE OPTIMIZATION BY USING MAX AND MIN\n- CONSTANT STATE VARIABLES\n- GAS OPTIMIZATION IN INCREMENTS\n- INTERNAL FUNCTIONS NEVER USED\n- MAKE PUBLIC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS INTERNAL\n- UNUSED IMPORTS\n- UNUSED NAMED RETURNS\n",

Violation of these rules can result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the Immunefi platform at the sole discretion of the Immunefi team, which may also result in: 1) the forfeiture and loss of access to all bug submissions, and 2) zero payout. \n\nPlease note that Immunefi has no tolerance for spam/low-quality/incomplete bug reports, “beg bounty” behavior, and misrepresentation of assets and severity. Immunefi exists to protect the global crypto community, not facilitate grift.\n\nProhibited: \n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n- [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules.
