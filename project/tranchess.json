This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nVulnerability reports concerning rounding errors with an effect of less than the equivalent of USD 0.01 are not eligible for a reward. Additionally, vulnerability impacts of the Exchange smart contract resulting in “contract consumes unbounded gas”, classified as __Medium__ in the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System, is not eligible for a reward as it is by design.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration the funds at risk, but also factoring in PR and branding considerations, at the discretion of the team.                     \nHowever, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Tranchess__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
