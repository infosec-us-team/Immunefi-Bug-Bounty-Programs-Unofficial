Users that stake ETH natively or with a liquid staking token (LST) can opt-in to EigenLayer smart contracts to restake their ETH or LST and extend cryptoeconomic security to additional applications on the network to earn additional rewards. \n\nFor more information about EigenLayer, please visit [https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/.](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/)  \n\nEigenLayer provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n \nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 2,000,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 250,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\nFor Critical website and application bug reports,  the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 100,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nFor High Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 250,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report. \n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nEigenLayer has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n- Any audits listed at https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/tree/mainnet/audits \n- Any audits listed at https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/security/audits",
