This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll Critical Blockchain/DLT and Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nIn addition to Immunefi’s Vulnerability Severity Classification System, Axelar Network classifies the following vulnerabilities as follows. In case of discrepancy, the one below will be followed.\n\nCritical\n  - Loss of funds of over or equal to $500,000\n\nHigh\n  - Vulnerabilities that result in loss of funds of less than $500,000\n\nMedium\n  - Vulnerabilities that result in loss of funds of less than $50,000\n\nLow\n  - Vulnerabilities that result in loss of funds of less than $10,000\n\nAny vulnerabilities discussed within the github issues below are considered vulnerabilities already known to Axelar, and will not be eligible for a reward:\n\n  - [https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/issues](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/issues) \n  - [https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-solidity/issues \n](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-solidity/issues) \n  - [https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/issues](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd/issues)\n  - [https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofn/issues](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofn/issues)\n\nCritical blockchain/ smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. There is no minimum reward for Critical smart contract vulnerabilities.  \n\nBug reports that are classified as High will be rewarded USD 10 000 and up to USD 50 000 at the Axelar team’s discretion. High impact rewards for the project bug bounty program are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 10 000 for High severity level, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program. Only impacts that cause a loss of funds of over or equal to $500K are considered as Critical \n\nAxelar Network requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. We use a service provider, Jumio, to collect this information and will send you a link to the KYC application if your report is deemed eligible for bounties. The information needed is\n\n  - A piece of government issued photo ID such as passport or driver’s license\n  - A live webcam facial recognition scan to match biometrics with submitted photo ID\n\nThe collection of this information will be done by the project team.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Axelar Network__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
