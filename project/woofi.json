It utilizes sPMM algorithm which allows market makers to simulate the price and depth of centralized exchange order books. \n\nStake allows users to stake WOO tokens to capture the swap fee from WOOFi and earn yields on WOO tokens. \n\nWOOFi plans to launch earn features soon. \n\nFor more information about WOOFi, please visit [https://fi.woo.org/](https://fi.woo.org/) \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Theft of governance funds\n  - Economic exploits",
