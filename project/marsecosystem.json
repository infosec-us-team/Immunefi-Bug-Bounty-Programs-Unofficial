      "programOverview": "The fundamental issue within most current stablecoin protocols is positive externality. The cost of producing and maintaining stablecoins are incurred by the protocol and its users (minters, share holders, bond holders). Whereas the majority of the value comes from the transaction of stablecoins within DeFi primitives and is captured by these DeFi primitives.\n\nMars Ecosystem solves this problem by integrating the creation and the use of stablecoin into one stable yet decentralized ecosystem. The relationship between Mars Stablecoin and Mars DeFi platform creates a positive feedback loop and generates a flywheel effect.\n\nMars Stablecoin (USDM) is price stable, capital efficient, scalable and decentralized. It is an over-backed stablecoin: the redeemability of USDM is backed by the Mars Ecosystem Governance Token (XMS). The market cap of XMS is always multiple times the market cap of Mars Stablecoin which ensures that the stablecoin can be redeemed 1:1 at any given time.\n\nMars Swap provides liquidity between Mars Stablecoin and all the other tokens, making USDM the ideal medium of exchange and store of value for DeFi. The incurred transaction fees generated at Mars Swap are used to back the stability of Mars Stablecoin.\n\nFor more information about Mars Ecosystem, please visit [https://marsecosystem.com/](https://marsecosystem.com/).    \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing the following impacts:\n\n  - Thefts and freezing of principal of any amount\n  - Thefts and freezing of unclaimed yield of any amount\n  - Theft of governance funds \n  - Governance activity disruption\n  - Website goes down\n  - Leak of user data\n  - Deletion of user data\n  - Access to sensitive pages without authorization\n  - Smart contracts fails to delivery promised returns based on APR",
