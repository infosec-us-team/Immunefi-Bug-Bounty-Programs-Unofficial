DeFi enthusiasts and projects alike rely on Opynâ€™s smart contracts and interface to hedge themselves against DeFi risks and take positions on different cryptocurrencies.\n\nGamma is a capital efficient option protocol that enables sellers to create spreads and other combinations, trade atomically, flash loan mint oTokens, assign operators to roll over vaults, create perpetual instruments, and more.\n\nJust like Convexity Protocol(Opyn v1), Gamma protocol enables any user to create option tokens, that represent the right to buy or sell a certain asset at a predefined price (strike price) at expiry. \n\nFor more information about Opyn, please visit [https://www.opyn.co/](https://www.opyn.co/).   \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nCritical and High severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 25 000__ for Critical bug reports.\n\nIssues identified in previous audit reports may not be eligible for payout. \n\nTo be eligible for reward, impact from table below must be demonstrated where all thefts must be profitable and all freezing must be reasonably priced for the impact.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Opyn__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts up to USD 100 000 are done in __USD__, __USDC__, __DAI__ or __ETH__.",
