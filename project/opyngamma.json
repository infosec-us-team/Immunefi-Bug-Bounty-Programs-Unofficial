This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nCritical and High severity bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 25 000__ for Critical bug reports.\n\nIssues identified in previous audit reports may not be eligible for payout. \n\nTo be eligible for reward, impact from table below must be demonstrated where all thefts must be profitable and all freezing must be reasonably priced for the impact.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Opyn__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
