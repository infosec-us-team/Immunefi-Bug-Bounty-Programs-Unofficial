      "programOverview": "Wormhole is a generic cross-chain messaging protocol that allows smart contracts on various blockchains to communicate with each other. Messages are routed from chain to chain by a decentralised group of guardian nodes who sign attestations of the on-chain state.\n\nFor more information about Wormhole, please visit [https://wormhole.com/](https://wormhole.com/).\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on preventing negative impacts on Wormhole and the Portal Token Bridge. It currently covers their smart contracts, guardian nodes, and Wormhole integrations with blockchains.\n\n__Submission Requirements__\n\nAll reports must include sufficient explanation and data to reproduce the bug easily, e.g., through a proof-of-concept code.\n\nWe require the bug reporter to comply with our KYC requirements before we pay for a bug report.\n\nThis includes the following:\n  - Wallet address where you’ll receive payment.\n  - Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with your address or a recent utility bill with your name, address, and issuer of the bill).\n  - A copy of your passport will be required.\n  - W rewards are limited to those persons who are (a) not U.S. Person as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Regulation S”) (b) is not domiciled in or has their principal place of business in the United States; (y) will conduct all transactions with the Tokens outside the United States and solely with non-US persons; and (z) is not acquiring the Tokens for the account or benefit of any U.S. Person and will not engage in any directed selling efforts in the United States.\n  - Any W to which you are entitled to receive as a reward will only be granted and delivered to you upon the execution by you of a Restricted Token Grant Agreement in the form required by Wormhole Foundation and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, including a lock-up on the W token as set forth therein.\n  - You shall be responsible for reporting and paying any current and future taxes that it may incur resulting from the grant or delivery of any W or cash compensation.\n  - If you report a critical bounty with a reward denominated in W, you may be entitled to receive the reward in USDC if you are unable to receive the reward in W.\n\nThese details will only be required upon determining that a bug report will be rewarded. They will remain strictly confidential among need-to-know individuals (basically, only individuals must verify KYC and process the payment).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in the scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Please note that for any valid Critical severity reports, the maximum reward will be up to $5,000,000 USD, paid in W token, with the following tiers: \n\n- __Tier 1:__ Ability to Extract the TVL of all chains: Up to $5,000,000 in W\n- __Tier 2:__ Ability to Extract the TVL of a single chain: Up to $2,500,000 in W \n- __Tier 3:__ Ability to permanently deny access to the TVL of one or many chains: Up to $1,250,000 in W \n\nAll rewards are decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the bug's exploitability, the feasibility of the exploit scenario, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, particularly if it is nondeterministic or some of the conditions are not present at the time.\n\nBecause of the governor, rewards for critical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of extractable value during a 24-hour period. The Governor (https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/node/pkg/governor) is designed to limit the value that can be transferred out of one chain over time. \n Rewards for vulnerabilities resulting in the perpetual locking of funds are further capped at the lesser of 1% of destroyable value or $1,250,000 in W.  Rewards for critical vulnerabilities relating to NFTs are further capped at $20,000 in W.\n\nValue is calculated based on the current market value and available liquidity for widely used tokens in the Portal Token Bridge, such as ETH and SOL. \n\nIn cases where the report achieves more than one of the above objectives, rewards will be tiered to the higher of the two objectives and will not be aggregated (e.g., if you can extract and brick a complete TVL for a chain, you will be awarded a bounty as if you could only extract the complete TVL for that chain).\n\nRewards for bugs in dependencies and third-party code are at the discretion of the Wormhole team and will be based on the impact demonstrated on Wormhole. If the dependency has its own bug bounty program, your reward for submitting this vulnerability to Wormhole will be lowered by the expected payout of that other program. If the vulnerability is in a connected blockchain rather than the Wormhole code, the locked and wrapped assets on that chain are not included in the impact calculation.\n\nVulnerabilities known to the Wormhole team at the time of reporting are ineligible for reward. This includes external audit reports, vulnerabilities in Wormhole's dependencies that have been disclosed publicly, and internal company communications. If necessary, the program will provide proof of prior knowledge about the issue.\n\nWormhole Foundation will maintain full discretion on vulnerability payouts. We encourage bug reporters to submit issues outside of the above-mentioned payout structure, though we want to be clear that we’ll exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis regarding whether an issue warrants a payout and what that ultimate payout would be.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": ".",
      "assetsBodyV2": "All Wormhole smart contracts can be found at https://github.com/wormhole-foundation. However, only those in the Assets in Scope table are considered in the bug bounty program's scope. In-scope items are those that are live on-chain or within an active Github release preparing for deployment.",
      "impactsBody": "For the impact to be permanent, it must result in an effect that the Wormhole team can’t directly fix and must be perpetual. For instance, making a smart contract on Ethereum completely unusable and un-upgradable. An anti-example is taking down Wormchain or the Guardian network—the Wormhole team controls both codebases and can be updated to remediate the reason for the outage. All other effects of denial of service are considered temporary in this program.\n\nBugs that are only triggerable against oneself and don’t affect other users, but are reasonable to be done on accident as an end user or application developer will be considered as no higher than low severity on a case-by-case basis. This excludes sending funds to unintended addresses which will not be rewarded.\n\nNative Token Transfer (NTT) is an open, flexible, and composable framework for transferring tokens across blockchains without liquidity pools. Only the listed GitHub repository is in the scope of this bounty program. Any forks or modifications are out of scope. Furthermore, only tagged releases with version v1.x.x are considered in-scope. The severity of NTT-related findings will be dropped by a single category on the payout scale, such as a critical to a high or a medium to a low.\n\nMulti-Gov is an extension of the OpenZeppelin Governor contracts that allows token holders to maintain their voting rights after bridging their tokens to another chain. Only the listed GitHub repository is in the scope of this bounty program. Any forks or modifications are out of scope. Furthermore, the rewards for Multi-Gov related findings will be capped at $100,000 USD.",
