By leveraging Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), users can collateralize their assets to mint DUSD. Users can then maximize their yield by staking, boost-vaulting, or providing liquidity with the borrowed DUSD, all within a single low-interest debt position.\n\nFor more information about Davos, please visit [https://davos.xyz/](https://davos.xyz/).",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Bug reports are required to include a runnable PoC in order to prove impact. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nAll rewards for the project bug bounty program are scaled based on an internally established team criteria, taking into account the exploitability of the bug, the impact it causes, and the likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself, which is especially factored in with bug reports requiring multiple conditions to be met that are currently not in-place. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 1 000 for each severity level, rewards will be provided at the determined fair value by the team depending on these conditions, assuming that the bug report is in-scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nAll vulnerabilities marked in [https://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/tree/main/audits](https://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/tree/main/audits) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Davos__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
