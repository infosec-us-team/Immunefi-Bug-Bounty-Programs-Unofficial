      "programOverview": "Equilibria Finance is a platform made for $PENDLE holders and liquidity providers, aiming to optimize profits through a tokenized version of vePENDLE, ePENDLE. It capitalizes on Pendle Finance's veToken/boosted yield model to enhance yields and reward PENDLE holders.\n\nFor more information about Equilibria, please visit [https://equilibria.fi/](https://equilibria.fi/)\n\nEquilibria provides rewards in EQB. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nEquilibria adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nEquilibria adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contracts: Critical\n- Smart Contracts: High\n\nIf a category’s severity level is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program as long as it involves an impact under that respective severity level. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other severity levels not listed here are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nEquilibria commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Equilibria will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nEquilibria has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD $100,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD $50,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.      \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities will be capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles for every additional 5 blocks that the funds or NFTs could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5, up to the hard cap of USD $5,000. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack will be counted, regardless of whether the smart contract is upgradable, pausable, or killable.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nEquilibria has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://64739487-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fb5P1hkrsWCfUtKNR9bnR%2Fuploads%2F5r1RtgYBP522L4FGQ3lx%2FEquilibria_Audit_Report_by_WatchPug.pdf?alt=media&token=64ae2a4d-115e-44cc-9451-a59a33e9f9e8](https://64739487-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fb5P1hkrsWCfUtKNR9bnR%2Fuploads%2F5r1RtgYBP522L4FGQ3lx%2FEquilibria_Audit_Report_by_WatchPug.pdf?alt=media&token=64ae2a4d-115e-44cc-9451-a59a33e9f9e8)\n- [https://64739487-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fb5P1hkrsWCfUtKNR9bnR%2Fuploads%2FFHRXG7oZJB5z0Ir5Ybpa%2FPeckShield-Audit-Report-Equilibria-v1.0.pdf?alt=media&token=d3d28a50-17f8-42fd-9739-edd416909e87](https://64739487-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fb5P1hkrsWCfUtKNR9bnR%2Fuploads%2FFHRXG7oZJB5z0Ir5Ybpa%2FPeckShield-Audit-Report-Equilibria-v1.0.pdf?alt=media&token=d3d28a50-17f8-42fd-9739-edd416909e87)\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nAt Immunefi, we sometimes receive reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. If it’s obviously feasible, then it seems there are no questions about severity or payout amount. But if the bug report is less feasible, or not really feasible at all, suddenly questions arise.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards)which by default states what a Projects should or should not cite when downgrading a bug report’s impact, severity, and/or payout amount. These standards are continuously being developed and updated  with help of the community and encompasses fair guidelines where the project clearly commits, and the security researcher can be assured that the project cannot arbitrarily downgrade the program based on theoretical counter measures, such as a [chain rollback. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contracts: Critical\n- Smart Contracts: High\n- Smart Contracts: Medium\n- Smart Contracts: Low\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Equilibria team directly and are done in __USDC__.\n",
