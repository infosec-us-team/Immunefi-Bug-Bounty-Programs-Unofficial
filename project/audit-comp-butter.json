      "programOverview": "Butter is a grantee of Uniswap Foundation and Optimism Foundation. **[Grant Allocation Announcement](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1846929189171351594)**.\n\nThe first iteration of Conditional Funding Markets will be launched on Feb 27th in partnership with Uniswap Foundation and Optimism Foundation. Both will allocate **[funding](https://x.com/SuperchainEco/status/1869803471102455857)** through the mechanism. Butter’s smart contracts will provide the conditional prediction markets that will instruct which project to fund. For this first version, the funding allocation decision rule will happen off-chain.\n\n **[Conditional Funding Markets (CFMs)](https://ggresear.ch/t/conditional-funding-markets/27/)**, an implementation of **[Futarchy](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy2013.pdf)**, are a special type of prediction market. CFMs leverage speculative markets to estimate the probability that a funding decision will produce a desired effect or metric before the funding decision is made. The resulting probability distribution of all possible allocations is subsequently used to allocate the funding.\n\nIn a vote-based system, a large token holder or influential delegate can consistently tilt funding decisions in their favour, regardless of whether the decision is in the interest of the protocol’s stakeholders and at little personal cost. In decision markets, traders are incentivized to find the outcome with the highest payoff. Betting against the market to fund a personal project using protocol resources is both expensive and, if successful, leaves the attacker holding worthless positions.\n\nThis Audit Competition is running on testnet. The following conditions apply:\n\n- Butter team will freeze the codebase during the duration of the Audit Competition \n- Concurrently Immunefi has cloned and frozen the repositories for the duration of the Audit Competition\n- Duplicates are rewarded\n- Bugs that aren't disclosed in the private audit report are valid for rewards. \n\nButter provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD on Ethereum.  \n\nFor more information about Butter, please visit https://buttery.gg",

Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report.

The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers are required to submit KYC within 14 days of KYC being requested, else their rewards may be forfeited. Immunefi may make exceptions due to extenuating circumstances.\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__\n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the audit review\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nWhitehats may publish their bug reports after they have been fixed & paid, or closed as invalid, with the following exceptions:\n- Bug reports in mediation may not be published until mediation has concluded and the bug report is resolved.\n\nImmunefi may publish bug reports submitted to this Audit Competition bug bounty and a leaderboard of the participants and their earnings.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nWhen there is uncertainty about how feasible an attack is Immunefi will use our feasibility limitation standards to determine the severity of the report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Butter has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",

However, **they are not included in the scope of this Audit Competition**.\n\nRealityETH version 3.0 is used. It is expected that the Arbitrator used is Kleros. Kleros might require some arbitration fee (see [here](https://forum.kleros.io/t/kip-72-court-proposal-on-ethereum-oracle-court/1279)).\n\n**Previous Audits**\n\nButter’s completed audit reports can be found at https://github.com/immunefi-team/audit-comp-butter-cfm-v1/tree/main/audits.

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
