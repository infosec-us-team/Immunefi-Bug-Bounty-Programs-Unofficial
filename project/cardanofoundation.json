We develop infrastructure tooling—including where there may not be an immediate commercial use case—plus strengthen operational resilience, and drive diversity of on-infrastructure use cases as well as the development of sound and representative governance.\n\nFor more information about The Cardano Foundation, please visit [https://cardanofoundation.org/](https://cardanofoundation.org/).  \n\nThe Cardano Foundation provides rewards in fiat USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nThe Cardano Foundation adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-explorer-api \n- https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-explorer-authentication \n- https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-explorer-frontend",
