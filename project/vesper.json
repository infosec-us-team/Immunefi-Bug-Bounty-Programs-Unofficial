The Vesper token (VSP) is the core economic engine that facilitates the building and expansion of Vesper’s capabilities and its community.\n\nThe Vesper project rests on three pillars:\n\n__Vesper Products:__ At launch, Vesper offers a variety of interest-yielding \"Grow Pools\" that enable users to passively increase their crypto holdings by simply selecting the desired aggressiveness of their strategy and the digital asset held. The Vesper Grow Pools represent the first product on the Vesper platform. More will be developed and presented over time.\n\n__Vesper Token:__ VSP incentivizes participation, facilitates governance, and catalyzes user contribution. Users earn VSP through pool participation and, later, participating in Vesper's continuous improvement.\n\n__Vesper Community:__ Vesper is building a user community that sustains and grows the product portfolio, facilitates progressive decentralization, and enables users to build new products while earning a share of that product's fees.\n\nFor more information about Vesper, please visit [https://vesper.finance/](https://vesper.finance/)",
