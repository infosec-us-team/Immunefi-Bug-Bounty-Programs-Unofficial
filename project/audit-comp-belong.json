Through its flagship product, Belong CheckIn, venues pay only for verified customer visits and spending, ensuring marketing efforts directly translate to measurable outcomes. The platform rewards promoters with visit bounties and a share of customer spend, all tracked transparently on-chain and paid instantly in LONG tokens. With a seamless Web2.5 approach, Belong eliminates the need for crypto wallets, making blockchain participation accessible to everyone. Beyond CheckIn, the Belong ecosystem enables tokenized venues and events, AI-driven community engagement, location-verified rewards, and on-chain bounty programs that bridge digital and physical interactions. Available on Web, iOS, and Android, Belong is redefining how physical spaces connect with digital communities through trust, transparency, and automation.",
