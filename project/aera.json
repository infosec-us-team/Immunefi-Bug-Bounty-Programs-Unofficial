      "programOverview": "Aera is a treasury management protocol that aims to address existing shortcomings with controlling treasury funds.\n\nFor more information about Aera, please visit [https://www.aera.finance/.](https://www.aera.finance/)  \n\nAera provides rewards in USDC. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n- Government-Issued ID or Corporate Charter Docs; EIN/TIN/ITIN or W9 (or equivalent); \n- Proof of current address\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.   \n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAera adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n\n__Invoicing Information__\n\nIf needed by the security researcher, Aera is able to provide the necessary information for the proper issuance of an invoice. This includes:\n- Legal Entity \n- Registered Address\n- Email where to send the invoice",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 180,000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 2,000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 600 blocks and then a third at 900 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 75% of the reward from the first attack, respectively.\n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- Employees and team members of third-party suppliers to Gauntlet Networks Inc. or Aera Foundation will also not be eligible for a reward.\n- Bug reports from OpenZeppelin team members and other third-party protocols that are used as Aera assets in the asset registry (including but not limited to Compound, Aave and others) are also not eligible for the bug bounty program (as they are considered critical infrastructure for Aera)\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs acknowledged below are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. \n- Risks of MEV in executed or submitted transactions\n- Risks associated with an untrusted guardian\n- Risks associated with faulty oracles or third-party ERC20/ERC4626 asset implementations\n- Risks associated with use of `execute` by treasury\n- Risks associated with unsanctioned collusion of different roles (e.g., guardian and owner of asset registry)\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAera has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n- [https://github.com/aera-finance/aera-contracts-public/blob/main/v2/audits/spearbit/2023-09-22.pdf ](https://github.com/aera-finance/aera-contracts-public/blob/main/v2/audits/spearbit/2023-09-22.pdf)\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract, Critical Severity Level\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Aera team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.",
