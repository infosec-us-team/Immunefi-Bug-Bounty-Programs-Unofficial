For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__\n\nThe provision of KYC is required to receive a reward for this bug bounty program where the following information will be required to be provided:\n- Government-Issued ID or Corporate Charter Docs; EIN/TIN/ITIN or W9 (or equivalent); \n- Proof of current address\n\nKYC information is only required on confirmation of the validity of a bug report.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nAera adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n\n__Invoicing Information__\n\nIf needed by the security researcher, Aera is able to provide the necessary information for the proper issuance of an invoice. This includes:\n- Legal Entity \n- Registered Address\n- Email where to send the invoice",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope. The final classification however takes into consideration the likelihood of the impact being achieved based on the table. When submitting a bug report, select the original assigned impact level, but please be aware that its severity level may be reassigned based on the likelihood according to this table.\n\n\n| | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| High Probability | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL |\n| Medium Probability  | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |\n| Low Probability  | LOW | LOW | MEDIUM |\n\nIn addition to Immunefiâ€™s Vulnerability Severity Classification System, Gauntlet classifies vulnerabilities using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In case of discrepancy, final determination is done by Gauntlet.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 600 blocks and then a third at 900 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 75% of the reward from the first attack, respectively.\n\n__Out of Scope__\n\nIn addition to previously discovered bugs acknowledged in published audits or bug bounty competitions linked here, the following are out of scope:\n- Risks of MEV in executed or submitted transactions\n- Risks associated with an untrusted guardian, accountant or solver\n- Risks associated with faulty oracles or third-party ERC20/ERC4626 asset implementations\n- Risks associated with use of `execute` by treasury\n- Risks associated with unsanctioned collusion of different roles (e.g., guardian and owner of asset registry)",
