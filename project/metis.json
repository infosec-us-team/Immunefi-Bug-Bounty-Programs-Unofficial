This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nAll smart contract bug reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum of __USD 50 000__ for Critical bug reports.\n\nMetis requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is the name, email address, phone number, company name (if applicable), and physical address.\n\nPayouts are handled by the Metis team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __METIS__.",
