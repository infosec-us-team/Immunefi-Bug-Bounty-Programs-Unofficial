Travel the vast and varied landscape hunting dangerous beasts, then capture them to battle in the Arenas or trade via the exchange.\n\nFor more information about Illuvium, please visit [https://www.illuvium.io/](https://www.illuvium.io/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts, website and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of funds (including yield, including freezing, theft),\n  - Frozen/malfunctioning contract state, \n  - Unavailability of web and/or blockchain assets,\n  - Authentication and authorization issues that could result in loss of user funds,\n  - Reputational damage",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "__Impacts in Scope__\n\nOnly the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Examples:__\nCritical Smart Contract Impacts:\n\nAbility to mint infinite amounts of reward tokens (ILV or sILV), unstake more pool tokens than the amount owned\n\nHigh Smart Contract Impacts:\n\nToken holders temporarily unable to transfer holdings, contract bug allowing funds to be send to nowhere, issues affecting new token(s) with small/limited circulation supply\n\nMedium Smart Contract Impacts:\n\nMore than five times the usual gas costs or unbounded gas for other users\n\nHigh Web Impacts:\n\nmodification of a page to include false instructions for community/players, malicious interactions with an already-connected wallet such as modifying transaction arguments or parameters, substituting contract addresses, submitting malicious transactions\n\nIn case of discrepancy between [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.1](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-1/) and Illuvium’s classification above, Illuvium classification will be followed.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2) This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. All Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nWe understand certain vulnerabilities may cross impact boundaries and it may be difficult to estimate the economic damage for some vulnerabilities. Illuvium will make every effort to reasonably estimate this using the criteria mentioned in impact categories (below).\n\nCritical vulnerabilities for smart contracts are rewarded in accordance with the amount specified in the table, but are capped at 10% of economic damage, whichever is lower. \n\nHigh vulnerabilities for smart contracts are rewarded in accordance with the amount specified in the table, but are capped at 5% economic damage, whichever is lower. \n\nThere are 4 main things you can provide which will help us to evaluate your submission quickly:\n  - Add a summary of the vulnerability,\n  - Add a step-by-step exploit process so we can reproduce the issue (for issues where a PoC is required),\n  - List any additional material / references (e.g. screenshots, logs etc.),\n  - Elaborate the perceived impact, should the vulnerability be exploited. \n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for the program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report in Illuvium. Previous audits of Illuvium smart contracts can be found at:\n  - [https://certificate.quantstamp.com/view/illuvium-part-4-staking-v-2](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/view/illuvium-part-4-staking-v-2) (StakingV2)\n  - [https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Illuvium-v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Illuvium-v1.0.pdf) (StakingV2)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Illuvium__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
