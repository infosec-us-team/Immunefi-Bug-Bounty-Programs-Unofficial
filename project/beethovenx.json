All balancer core contracts are covered by their [bug bounty program](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/bug-bounties) which Beethoven-X is participating in.",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward.  All High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 20 000__. \n\nHigh severity smart contract vulnerabilities are also further capped at 10% of economic damage,  primarily taking into consideration funds at risk. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 5 000__.\n\nAll vulnerabilities marked in the [Trail of Bits security review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XmsPprcXtbsa1DcbRkNwsr60vwrDeynu/view?usp=sharing) and [Balancer Audits](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/audits/trail-of-bits/2021-12-22.pdf) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Beethoven X__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
