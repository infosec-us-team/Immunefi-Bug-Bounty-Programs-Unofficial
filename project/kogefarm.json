      "programOverview": "KogeFarm is a low-fee, multi-chain yield aggregator/optimizer that automates reward harvesting and yield compounding across hundreds of farms from dozens of yield farm platforms. It was launched in May 2021 on the Polygon chain and is quickly expanding to others.\n\nFor more information about KogeFarm, please visit [https://kogefarm.io/vaults](https://kogefarm.io/vaults). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and app and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "We are especially interested in receiving and rewarding vulnerabilities of the following types:\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__ \n\n  - Re-entrancy\n  - Logic errors\n    - including user authentication errors\n  - Solidity/EVM details not considered\n    - including integer over-/under-flow\n    - including rounding errors\n    - including unhandled exceptions\n  - Trusting trust/dependency vulnerabilities\n    - including composability vulnerabilities\n  - Oracle failure/manipulation\n  - Novel governance attacks\n  - Economic/financial attacks\n    - including flash loan attacks\n  - Congestion and scalability\n    - including running out of gas\n    - including block stuffing\n    - including susceptibility to frontrunning\n  - Consensus failures\n  - Cryptography problems\n    - Signature malleability\n    - Susceptibility to replay attacks\n    - Weak randomness\n    - Weak encryption\n  - Susceptibility to block timestamp manipulation\n  - Missing access controls / unprotected internal or debugging interfaces",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\nSmall difference between principal and vault shares due to rounding to 10^18 decimals.\n\nIn addition to Immunefi’s Vulnerability Severity Classification System, KogeFarm classifies the following vulnerabilities as follows. In case of discrepancy, the one below will be followed. \n\nCritical\n  - Theft of principal is critical if the possible theft is greater than USD 100000.\n  - Freezing of principal is critical if it cannot be unfrozen, with impacted amounts greater than USD 100000.\n\nKogeFarm requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is the bug bounty hunter's face and document verification using [https://kycaid.com/](https://kycaid.com/). The collection of this information will be done by the KogeFarm team. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __KogeFarm__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n  - Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n  - Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__\n\n  - Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n    - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n  - Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n  - Lack of liquidity\n  - Best practice critiques\n  - Sybil attacks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n  - Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n  - Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n  - Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n  - Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n  - Any denial of service attacks\n  - Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n  - Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty",
