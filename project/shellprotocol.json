      "programOverview": "Shell Protocol is a set of EVM-based smart contracts on Arbitrum One. Unlike other DeFi protocols that rely on monolithic, single-purpose smart contracts, Shell is a hub for a modular ecosystem of services. Its design makes it much simpler to bundle several smart contracts or build new ones, and for users to batch many services in one transaction.\n\nKnown for simplifying DeFi for both users and developers, Shell is a public resource to be governed by the upcoming Shell DAO.\n\nFor more information about Shell Protocol, please visit [https://shellprotocol.io/  ](https://shellprotocol.io/)\n\nPayouts are handled by the Shell Protocol team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in USDC.. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nShell Protocol adheres to category 1. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Rules__\n\nShell Protocol adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated in this page.\n\n__Immunefi Severity Classification System__\n\nThis program was designed using the Immunefi classification system. Bugs are classified on a simplified 4-level scale:\n- Critical\n- High\n- Medium\n- Low\n\nSee: [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System v2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards by Threat Level are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Smart Contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of $100,000 USD. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of $25,000 USD is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a bug report.   \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contracts, Critical Severity Level\n- Smart Contracts, High Severity Level\n- Smart Contracts, Medium Severity Level\n- Smart Contracts, Low Severity Level\n- Web/App, All Levels\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Shell Protocol team directly and are denominated in USD. Payments will be issued in USDC or ETH.\n",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "These impacts are out of scope for this bug bounty program. \n\n__All Categories__\n\n- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist) except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code\n- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Feature requests\n- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain/DLT__ \n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles:\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity impacts\n- Impacts involving centralization risks\n- Best practice recommendations\n\n__Web/App__ \n\n- Captcha bypass using OCR without impact demonstration\n- UX and UI impacts that do not materially disrupt use of the platform\n- Impacts primarily caused by browser/plugin defects\n- Leakage of non sensitive API keys (e.g. Etherscan, Infura, Alchemy, etc.)\n- Any vulnerability exploit requiring browser bugs for exploitation (e.g. CSP bypass) \n- Automated scanner reports without demonstrated impact\n- UI/UX best practice recommendations\n- Non-future-proof NFT rendering\n",
