This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ and a maximum reward of __USD 200 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused.\n\nHigh severity smart contract vulnerabilities will be further capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles for every additional 5 blocks that the funds could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5, up to the hard cap of 20 000 USD. This is implemented in order to account for the increased relative impact based on the duration of the freezing of funds.\n\nAll calculations of the amount of funds at risk are done based on the time the bug report is submitted.\n\nThe Sandbox requires all bug bounty hunters to complete the program’s KYC requirements if they are submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is an ID photo along with a scan of a utility bill to show residency proof.\n\nBug reports from compensated team members of any The Sandbox core units will not be eligible for a reward. Employees and team members of third-party suppliers to core units that operate in a technical capacity and have assets covered in this bug bounty program will also not be eligible for a reward. All team members of the audit companies The Sandbox works with, and its third-party suppliers, including Immunefi itself and its subsidiaries, are not eligible for a reward.\n\nBug reports from team members and third-party suppliers of businesses and organizations that are not a The Sandbox Core Unit but have assets considered as critical infrastructure covered under the bug bounty program are also not eligible for the bug bounty program.\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for the program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report.\n\nThe following issues are considered known and are not eligible for a reward:\n  - __Contract:__ ERC20BasicApproveExtension (Ethereum & Polygon)\n    __Method:__ paidCall\n    __Description:__ The paidCall method when called on Sand contract can add an allowance for the caller to transfer Sand tokens owned by the contract itself. However, the contract will have a sand balance only if users send it to the contract address by mistake.\n  - __Contract:__ all the implementation contracts\n    __Description:__ the implementation contracts’ lack of initialization will end up with anyone owning/managing/minting tokens.\n\nAll issues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are also considered out of scope:\n[https://github.com/thesandboxgame/sandbox-smart-contracts/tree/master/packages/core/documentation/audits](https://github.com/thesandboxgame/sandbox-smart-contracts/tree/master/packages/core/documentation/audits)  \n\nPayouts are handled by the __The Sandbox__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
