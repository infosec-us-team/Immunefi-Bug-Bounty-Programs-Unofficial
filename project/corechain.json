Core Chain is powered by Satoshi Plus consensus, a combination of Delegated Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake that incorporates Bitcoin miners in the security of a scalable smart contract platform.\n\nFor more information about Core Chain, please visit [https://coredao.org/](https://coredao.org/) \n\nRewards for participating in Satoshi Plus consensus are paid out in CORE tokens. For more details about this process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nKYC information is required for the payment resulting from successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n\n  - Full name \n  - Date of birth\n  - Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n  - Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\nSecurity researchers must pass OFAC screening and cannot be on the SDN list. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nCore Foundation adheres to category 3 __Approval Required__. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nCore Foundation adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following severity levels:\n\n  - Blockchain/DLT - Critical\n\nCore Foundation adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n  - Blockchain/DLT - High - Unintended chain split (Network partition)\n  - Blockchain/DLT - Medium - Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments\n  - Blockchain/DLT - High - Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters\n  - Blockchain/DLT - Medium - Shutdown of greater than or equal to 30% of network processing nodes without brute force actions, but does not shut down the network\n  - Smart Contract - High - Manipulation of governance voting result deviating from voted outcome and resulting in a direct change from intended effect of original results\n  - Smart Contract - Critical - Direct theft of a significant amount (greater than $1 million) of user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield.\n  - Smart Contract - Medium - Direct theft of any amount user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Smart Contract - Critical - Permanent freezing of funds that cannot be undone by network code update\n  - Smart Contract - Medium - Permanent freezing of funds that can be undone by network code update\n  - Web/App - Critical - Execute arbitrary system private of internal commands\n  - Web/App - Critical - Retrieve sensitive data/files from a running server\n  - Web/App - Critical - Taking state-modifying actions which are limited to platform-contracts (with or without blockchain state interaction) on behalf of other other accounts e.g. performing a Governance-only action from another account\n  - Web/App - High - Taking state-modifying authenticated actions (with or without blockchain state interaction) on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user\n  - Web/App - Critical - Subdomain takeover with already-connected wallet interaction\n  - Web/App - Critical - Direct theft of user funds\n  - Web/App - Critical - Malicious interactions with an already-connected wallet that results in significant ether lost\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nTestnet and mock files are not covered under the Primacy of Impact. \nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nCore Foundation commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Core Foundation will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms. \n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nCore Foundation has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n\n__Other Terms and Information__\n\nAs a general rule it should be noted that Core Foundation always assumes governance good-will hence defects that rely on governance cooperation will probably not be accepted. Note that we are still interested in bugs where governance is manipulated against it’s will.\n\nAdditionally it should be noted that Core Foundation is the sole owner and deployer on the network code which reflects on the impacts stated in the Impacts in Scope Table.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical Blockchain/DLT bugs, the reward will be determined based on the funds at risk, but may also consider subsequent impacts on other projects built on the respective blockchain,, capped at the maximum critical reward __USD 250 000__. \n\nThe following critical Blockchain/DLT bugs will have a reward of up to __USD 100 000__\n\n  - Network not being able to confirm new transactions (Total network shutdown)\n  - Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (Network partition requiring hard fork)\n\nCritical website and application bug reports will be rewarded with up to __USD 15 000__, only if the impact leads to:\n\n  - An impact of a loss of funds in a sum greater than __USD 1 000 000__ involving an attack that does not require any user action at all\n  - Private key leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds \n\nAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical, or an impact resulting in a theft of funds that does not fall under this definition, would be rewarded in up to __USD 20 000__\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for blockchain/DLT bugs, only the first attack is considered if the component where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a component directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded, paused, or killed, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds at actual risk. A reduction of 25% from the first amount of the first attack for every one hour the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. \n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n  - High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.   \n\n  - In the event of temporary freezing, the reward increases at a multiplier of two from the full frozen value for every additional 21 blocks that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward of __USD 100 000__. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.    \n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n  - If a user stakes and does not claim rewards for a very long time (say a year+), it is possible he will run out of gas next time he stakes/unstakes/transfers/etc.  The reason is that the system will try to claim all pending rewards before the action is executed.\n  - [https://mirror.xyz/0x333247F2e126954ed6428e9135Ae9dE06A76BA32/a6HqOCOjJ10Bosyi0cGz6Lxff8t68Uo4YvFsVg2tHaw](https://mirror.xyz/0x333247F2e126954ed6428e9135Ae9dE06A76BA32/a6HqOCOjJ10Bosyi0cGz6Lxff8t68Uo4YvFsVg2tHaw)\n  - GETH Previous Bugs\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nCore Foundation has provided these completed audit review reports for reference. Any unfixed vulnerability mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n  - [https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain/tree/master/audit](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain/tree/master/audit)\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards?utm_source=immunefi#:~:text=Some%20examples%20of%20feasibility%20limitations,attempt%20to%20exploit%20the%20bug.) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by __Core Foundation__ team directly and are denominated in __USD__. However, payments are done in __CORE__ tokens. \n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability. For avoidance of doubt, if the reward amount is USD 5 000 and the average price is USD 1.75 per token, then the reward will be 2857.142857 units of that token.",
