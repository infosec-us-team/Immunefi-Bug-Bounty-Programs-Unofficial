The Sweat Wallet is a crypto app that rewards people with a cryptocurrency, SWEAT, for their steps, which are verified by a separate app, Sweatcoin. SWEAT is built on the NEAR blockchain, and the Sweat Wallet is by far the most used DApp on this network. The token has much utility; it can be used to access rewards, like BTC, USDT and Macbooks, or used in staking and DeFi functions like crypto swap, and as fuel for Sweat Hero, a peer-to-peer NFT game.\n\nFor more information, visit [https://sweateconomy.com/.](https://sweateconomy.com/)",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__  for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [https://github.com/sweatco/sweat-near/security/policy](https://github.com/sweatco/sweat-near/security/policy)\n- [https://github.com/sweatco/sweat-jar/security/policy](https://github.com/sweatco/sweat-jar/security/policy)\n- [https://github.com/sweatco/sweat-claim/security/policy](https://github.com/sweatco/sweat-claim/security/policy)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Sweat Foundation__ directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__ (ERC20/NEP141) and __SWEAT__ (ERC20/NEP141), at the discretion of the project.",
