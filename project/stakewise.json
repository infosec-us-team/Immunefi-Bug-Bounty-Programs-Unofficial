      "programOverview": "StakeWise is a protocol for liquid staking on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain. By staking their assets through StakeWise, users receive staked ETH and staked GNO tokens that represent their deposit and earnings, and can be swapped back into ETH and GNO via liquidity pools or deposited into DeFi protocols for extra yield. The protocol is run by the StakeWise DAO, which decides on the deployment of StakeWise DAO Treasury, the distribution of ETH and GNO across node operators, and choice of various smart contract parameters.\n\nFor more information about StakeWise, please visit [https://stakewise.io/](https://stakewise.io/).",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. In addition, all bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nKnown issues highlighted in their previous audits here are considered out of scope of this program:\n  - [https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits) \n\nPayouts are handled by the __StakeWise__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
