This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app and blockchain/DLT bug reports, as well as all Critical/High/Medium severity smart contract bug reports, must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. \n\nIn addition, all Critical severity bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 25 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nQ Blockchain requires that all bug bounty hunters who are eligible for a reward submit an invoice to Q Development AG, which administers and pays out bounty rewards. Please note that Q Development will need to perform a KYC check on the bug bounty hunter claiming the reward. Information typically required in a KYC check includes the name and address of the bug bounty hunter and a copy of the passport, or in case of a corporation, a trade register excerpt or similar. Please also note that Q Development AG cannot make payments to officially sanctioned/blacklisted countries. If in doubt, please feel free to get in touch with the team prior to submitting a reward payout claim. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Q Blockchain__ team directly and are denominated in USD.

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
