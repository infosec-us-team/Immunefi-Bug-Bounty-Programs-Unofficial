This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll web/app and blockchain/DLT bug reports, as well as all Critical/High/Medium severity smart contract bug reports, must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. \n\nIn addition, all Critical severity bug reports must come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 25 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nQ Blockchain requires that all bug bounty hunters who are eligible for a reward submit an invoice to Q Development AG, which administers and pays out bounty rewards. Please note that Q Development will need to perform a KYC check on the bug bounty hunter claiming the reward. Information typically required in a KYC check includes the name and address of the bug bounty hunter and a copy of the passport, or in case of a corporation, a trade register excerpt or similar. Please also note that Q Development AG cannot make payments to officially sanctioned/blacklisted countries. If in doubt, please feel free to get in touch with the team prior to submitting a reward payout claim. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Q Blockchain__ team directly, with payments processed in [QGOV](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/q-protocol/) token and paid out on the Q Protocol Network.",
