      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll web and app bugs must come with a Proof of Concept (PoC) in order to be accepted. All web and app bug reports without a PoC will be rejected with a request for a PoC. Critical web and app bugs can only be paid the full USD 15 000 if there is a vulnerability directly leading to a loss in user funds that don’t require social engineering or extensive non-normal user actions. \n\nRewards for smart contract vulnerabilities are variable based on their exploitability, and other factors deemed relevant by the MUX team. For critical vulnerabilities, the payout is capped at 10% of economic damage and is the main determinant of the reward amount. Bug reports for critical vulnerabilities also require PoC. If no PoC is submitted but the bug is still validated and addressed, only USD 20 000 will be rewarded regardless of economic damage. \n\nRecommendations for fixes are required for a reward. Though bug reports without recommendations for fixes may be considered, the resulting reward cannot be the maximum amount. \n\nThe final decision for all rewards are at the discretion of MUX Protocol. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __MUX Protocol__ team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in __USDC__. However, for payouts USD 1 000 and lower, the reward can be paid in __ETH__.",

      "feasibilityLimitations": "The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
