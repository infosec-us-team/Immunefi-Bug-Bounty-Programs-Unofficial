Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the primary consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the team’s discretion. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 25 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Pact__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
