      "programOverview": "Ceres is one of the first projects on SORA (XOR) blockchain. Ceres is developing DeFi services and utilities for new projects and tokens on Polkaswap (Cross-chain exchange on SORA/Polkadot). \n\nCeres ecosystem consists of four concepts:\n\n  - Burning - Ceres tokens will be burned over time and supply will be constantly reducing.\n  - Governance - Ceres token holders can influence decisions concerning the project such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals.\n  - Airdrops - Every Ceres holder can get each of three Ceres Airdrop tokens which will have its own platforms with different purposes.\n  - Treasury - Community will be making proposals for the use and Ceres holders will have the right to vote for them.\n\nThere are also 3 Airdrop tokens for Ceres holders: Demeter, Hermes and Apollo. Each of the tokens will have its own platform with different purposes. Fees from those platforms will be used for burning and other ecosystem uses.\n\nThese are the current products so far:\n\n  - Ceres Tools (like Dextools but for Polkaswap) - [https://tools.cerestoken.io](https://tools.cerestoken.io/)\n  - Liquidity Locker - [https://dapps.cerestoken.io/liquidity_locker](https://dapps.cerestoken.io/liquidity_locker) \n  - Token Locker - [https://dapps.cerestoken.io/token_locker](https://dapps.cerestoken.io/token_locker) \n  - Ceres Governance - [https://dapps.cerestoken.io/governance](https://dapps.cerestoken.io/governance) \n  - Demeter Farming Platform - [https://farming.deotoken.io](https://farming.deotoken.io/)\n  - DEO Arena - [https://deoarena.io](https://deoarena.io/) (first Play-to-Earn game on SORA)\n  - Ceres Launchpad - [https://dapps.cerestoken.io/launchpad](https://dapps.cerestoken.io/launchpad)\n\nFor more information about Ceres, please visit [https://cerestoken.io](https://cerestoken.io)",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate classifications for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a Proof of Concept (PoC) with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __SORA__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
