      "programOverview": "Beanstalk Farms is a decentralized development organization working on Beanstalk, Basin and Pipeline. \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on securing all 4 projects:\n\n  - [Beanstalk](https://bean.money/) is a permissionless fiat stablecoin protocol;\n  - [Basin](https://basin.exchange/) is a composable EVM-native decentralized exchange protocol; and\n  - [Pipeline](https://evmpipeline.org/) is a sandbox contract that can execute an arbitrary number of actions within the EVM from an EOA in a single transaction. \n\nThere is a list of resources (docs, repositories, etc.) under the Assets in Scope section. You can also check out [past bug reports](https://community.bean.money/bug-reports?utm_source=immunefi) and [past bounty payouts](https://snapshot.org/?utm_source=immunefi#/beanstalkbugbounty.eth) for this bug bounty program.\n\nBounties are paid in BEAN via the [Beanstalk Immunefi Committee Multisig (BICM)](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bicm-dashboard). For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Eligibility Criteria__ \n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n\n  - A member of the [Beanstalk Immunefi Committee (BIC)](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bicm-dashboard); or\n  - A private auditor that has been paid by Beanstalk Farms or a related party to review the code that is reported to be vulnerable.\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nThe Beanstalk bug bounty program adheres to category __1 - Transparent__. This Policy determines that researchers can make public any information from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nThe Beanstalk bug bounty program adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms stated on this page.\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nAudit reports of the various in-scope assets can be found at [https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Audits](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Audits?utm_source=immunefi). Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports (or otherwise known by the BIC or BCM) are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe program may be receiving reports that are valid (the vulnerability is legitimate) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing any sort of attack in the real world. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that may be taken to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of[ feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, the Beanstalk bug bounty program has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). The following is a simplified 3-level scale, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. The complete scope can be found below.\n\nIn order to be considered for the maximum potential reward, bug reports must come with a Proof of Concept (PoC). Explanations and statements are not accepted in lieu of a PoC. Bug reports that do not come with a PoC may qualify for a maximum of up to 30% of the potential reward outlined below, as determined by the Beanstalk Immunefi Committee. \n\nFunds at Risk for a given bug report are defined as follows:\n\n  - Funds at Risk are determined based on the token amounts and USD values at time of the bug report submission;\n  - For Beans, Funds at Risk are determined based on the liquidatable USD value of the Beans at risk;\n  - For non-Beans (ETH, WETH, 3CRV, USDC, DAI, USDT, etc.) in any in-scope assets, the Funds at Risk are determined based on their respective USD values;\n  - For Circulating non-Beans (i.e., outside of any in-scope assets), the Funds at Risk are determined to be 50% of their respective USD values; and\n  - If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the Funds at Risk in initial attacks that can be executed within the first hour will be considered for a reward.\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Smart Contract Reports__\n\nRewards for Critical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at the lower of (a) 10% of practicable economic damage, or (b) __USD 1 100 000__, primarily taking into consideration the Funds at Risk. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical severity smart contract bug reports.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Smart Contract Reports__\n\nRewards for High smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at the lower of (a) 10% of practicable economic damage, or (b) __USD 100 000__, primarily taking into consideration the Funds at Risk. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__ for High severity smart contract bug reports.\n\n__Reward Calculation for Medium Smart Contract and All Website and Applications Reports__\n\nRewards for Medium severity smart contract vulnerabilities and all website and applications vulnerabilities are scaled based on a set of internal criteria established by the BIC. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 1 000 for Medium smart contract bug reports, __USD 5 000__ for Critical website and applications bug reports and __USD 1 000__ for High website and applications bug reports. The BIC will primarily take into account:\n\n  - The exploitability of the bug;\n  - The impact it causes; and\n  - The likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the [Beanstalk Immunefi Committee Multisig (BICM)](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bicm-dashboard) directly and are done in BEAN at the rate of 1 BEAN to 1 USD (i.e., amounts listed above are actually in BEAN) independent of liquidity (see BEAN liquidity [here](https://app.bean.money/#/analytics?bean=liquidity)—as of writing, Beans have over $28M of liquidity, primarily on [Basin](https://basin.exchange/#/wells)). Note that due to the decentralized governance process for rewarding bug bounties, rewards can take several days to be paid out after a report is confirmed to be valid.\n\n__BIC Determination__\n\nThe BIC shall determine whether a submitting party is entitled to a bug bounty/reward, and if so, the amount of such bounty/reward (and specifically, whether such submission qualifies for a Critical, High or Medium Impact bounty/reward, what is the potential practicable economic damage of such bug based on the Funds at Risk, and what the appropriate bounty/reward should be within each Impact range). The BIC’s determination of (i) whether such submission qualifies for a Critical, High or Medium Impact bounty/reward, (ii) what is the potential practicable economic damage of such bug based on the Funds at Risk, and (iii) whether such submission came with a PoC, thereby enabling it to be considered for the maximum potential applicable reward (vs. a submission that did not come with a PoC, thereby limiting such submission to a maximum of up to 30% of the applicable reward), shall be made in the BIC’s sole and absolute discretion absolute and shall be final, and not be subject to any appeal or challenge.\n\nA submitting party may only dispute the BIC’s determination (a) that a submitting party is not entitled to any bug bounty/reward, or (b) what the appropriate bounty/reward should be within each Impact range. In such disputes, Immunefi will conduct a binding mediation. If the submitting party disputes the BIC’s decision that a submitting party is not entitled to any bug bounty/reward, Immunefi will mediate, and shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, which is non-appealable, whether the submitting party is entitled to any bug bounty/reward, and if so, the amount of such bug bounty/reward, up to __USD 10 000__ in the case of a smart contract bug reports (i.e., as if it were a Medium Impact fix), and up to __USD 1 000__ in the case of a website and applications bug report (i..e, as if it were a High Impact fix). If the submitting party disputes the BIC’s determination what the appropriate bounty/reward should be within a specific Impact range, Immunefi will mediate, and shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, which is non-appealable, the amount of such bug bounty/reward in the relevant Impact category; however, Immunefi may not modify or change (i) the practicable economic damage determination made by the BIC, or (b) the BIC’s determination whether such submission came with a PoC, thereby enabling it to be considered it for the maximum potential applicable reward (vs. a submission that did not come with a PoC, thereby limiting such submission to a maximum of up to 30% of the applicable reward).",
