Root is a protocol built on top of Beanstalk.\n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on securing all 4 projects:\n\n  - [Beanstalk](https://bean.money/) is a permissionless fiat stablecoin protocol;\n  - [Basin](https://basin.exchange/) is a composable EVM-native decentralized exchange protocol;\n  - [Pipeline](https://evmpipeline.org/) is a sandbox contract that can execute an arbitrary number of actions within the EVM from an EOA in a single transaction; and\n  - [Root](https://roottoken.org/) is a permissionless fungible wrapper that enables collective farming for Beanstalk Silo Deposits.\n\nThere is a list of resources (docs, repositories, etc.) under the Assets in Scope section. You can also check out [past bug reports](https://community.bean.money/bug-reports) and [past bounty payouts](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkbugbounty.eth) for this bug bounty program.",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the *Assets in Scope* section.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). The following is a simplified 3-level scale, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. The complete scope can be found below.\n\nIn order to be considered for the maximum potential reward, bug reports must come with (1) a Proof of Concept (PoC), and (2) code implementing the fix. Explanations and statements are not accepted in lieu of a PoC and code implementing the fix. Bug reports that do not come with a PoC and code implementing a fix may qualify for a maximum of up to 30% of the potential reward outlined below, as determined by the [Beanstalk Immunefi Committee](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bic-process). Given that the focus of the bug bounty program is Beans/BDV at risk, Circulating non-Bean assets at risk may qualify for a maximum of up to 50% of the potential reward outlined below, as determined by the BIC.\n\nRewards for Critical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at the __lower__ of (a) 10% of practicable economic damage, or (b) __USD 1 100 000__, primarily taking into consideration Beans/BDV at risk. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 100 000__ for Critical severity smart contract bug reports. \n\nRewards for High smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at the __lower__ of (a) 100% of practicable economic damage, or (b) __USD 100 000__, primarily taking into consideration Beans/BDV at risk. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 10 000__ for High severity smart contract bug reports. \n\nRewards for Medium severity smart contract vulnerabilities and all website and applications vulnerabilities are scaled based on a set of internal criteria established by the BIC. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 1 000__ for Medium smart contract bug reports, __USD 5 000__ for Critical website and applications bug reports and __USD 1 000__ for High website and applications bug reports. The BIC will primarily take into account:\n  - The exploitability of the bug;\n  - The impact it causes; and\n  - The likelihood of the vulnerability presenting itself.\n\nPayouts are handled by the [Beanstalk Community Multisig (BCM)](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bcm-process) directly and are done in BEAN at the rate of 1 BEAN to 1 USD (i.e., amounts listed above are actually in BEAN).\n\nAll vulnerabilities noted in [any audit report in the Beanstalk Audits repository](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Audits) (or otherwise known by the BIC, BCM, or [Root DAO Multisig](https://docs.roottoken.org/governance/root-token/rdm-dashboard)) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nThe BIC shall determine whether a submitting party is entitled to a bug bounty/reward, and if so, the amount of such bounty/reward (and specifically, whether such submission qualifies for a Critical, High or Medium Impact bounty/reward, what is the potential practicable economic damage of such bug based on the Beans/BDV at risk, and what the appropriate bounty/reward should be within each Impact range). The BIC’s determination of (i) whether such submission qualifies for a Critical, High or Medium Impact bounty/reward, (ii) what is the potential practicable economic damage of such bug based on the Beans/BDV at risk, and (iii) whether such submission came with a PoC and code implementing a fix, thereby enabling it to be considered for the maximum potential applicable reward (vs. a submission that did not come with a PoC and code implementing a fix, thereby limiting such submission to a maximum of up to 30% of the applicable reward), shall be made in the BIC’s sole and absolute discretion absolute and shall be final, and not be subject to any appeal or challenge.  \n\nA submitting party may only dispute the BIC’s determination (a) that a submitting party is not entitled to any bug bounty/reward, or (b) what the appropriate bounty/reward should be within each Impact range. In such disputes, Immunefi will conduct a binding mediation. If the submitting party disputes the BIC’s decision that a submitting party is not entitled to any bug bounty/reward, Immunefi will mediate, and shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, which is non-appealable, whether the submitting party is entitled to any bug bounty/reward, and if so, the amount of such bug bounty/reward, up to __USD 10 000__ in the case of a smart contract bug reports (i.e., as if it were a Medium Impact fix), and up to __USD 1 000__ in the case of a website and applications bug report (i..e, as if it were a High Impact fix). If the submitting party disputes the BIC’s determination what the appropriate bounty/reward should be within a specific Impact range, Immunefi will mediate, and shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, which is non-appealable, the amount of such bug bounty/reward in the relevant Impact category; however, Immunefi may not modify or change (i) the practicable economic damage determination made by the BIC, or (b) the BIC’s determination whether such submission came with a PoC and code implementing a fix, thereby enabling it to be considered it for the maximum potential applicable reward (vs. a submission that did not come with a PoC and code implementing a fix, thereby limiting such submission to a maximum of up to 30% of the applicable reward).  \n",
