      "programOverview": "Hourglass is a decentralized protocol designed to facilitate large, cheap, chain-agnostic stable swaps. \n\nSwitching from USDC on Ethereum to USDT on Arbitrum—or from BEP20-BUSD to Polygon-DAI—is just a single transaction away. Most users will find the swap completed and the destination tokens in their wallet within 5 minutes!\n\nTo run the protocol, Hourglass organizes transactions into different \"epochs.\" Within these epochs, matched orders are bundled and relayed through a cross-chain messaging system. The corresponding funds are then disbursed to the appropriate wallet addresses on the destination chain.\n\nFor more information about Hourglass, please visit https://www.hourglass.money/\n\nHourglass provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nHourglass adheres to category 3 - Approval Required. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication ](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/)page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nHourglass adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Permanent freezing of funds\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Protocol insolvency\n- Smart Contract - High - Temporary freezing of funds\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nHourglass commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Hourglass will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission. \n\nIn a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- State Updates in Incorrect Order\n- L0 Config Centralization risk, could freeze funds\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nHourglass’ completed audit reports can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rV2aZVunue-G36RUsC8H4D9HMBYdfxFH/view. Any unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards)which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Hourglass has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 5 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 4 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\nFor critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward. \n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\nHigh vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.   \n\nIn the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Hourglass team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
