      "programOverview": "Alchemix is your unified platform for saving, earning, borrowing, and fixed-term fixed-yield opportunities—all in one place. Built on years of iteration since launching the original self-repaying loan in 2021, Alchemix v3 brings all three pillars together with a smarter, more flexible design. The protocol allows you to:\n\n- Save and grow – deposit ETH or USDC and let our vault invest and earn yield across diversified strategies.\n- Borrow up to 90% LTV – access liquidity now while your collateral grows with yield and your leverage is reduced over time through scheduled redemptions. No interest rates to monitor, no price-based liquidations.\n- Earn fixed-rate yield – lock in predictable returns through fixed-term redemptions of alETH or alUSD.\n\nThere are a few elements to the system. \nFirst, there is the Meta Yield Token. This is a Morpho V2 vault with custom strategies and some custom admin roles. There is an ETH and a USDC vault for each chain. \n\nThe core system is based around the Alchemist/Transmuter. Alchemists mint alAssets, and accept MYT as collatearl. Each Alchemist has a single alAsset it can mint (alETH for ETH, alUSD for USDC). Each Alchemist can only accept a single MYT token as collateral (MYT ETH for alETH Alchemist). Each Alchemist has a single Transmuter paired with it, and each Transmuter is only paired with a single Alchemist. \n\nThe Transmuter’s role is to redeem alAssets. Users may deposit alAssets to the transmuter. After a fixed period of time, they may claim equivalent value (based on protocol assumption that 1 alAsset = 1 Underlying, ie 1 alETH = 1 ETH) of the MYT. \n\nThe Alchemist’s role is to accept the MYT as collateral, mint alAsset debt, and fulfill redemption obligations to the transmuter. When a transmuter claim is executed, the Alchemist reduces global system debt, and sends MYT from the alchemist to the transmuter user. Thus, when a redemption occurs, an individual Alchemist position will see both their collateral and debt reduced. \n\nTo ensure collateral will always be available for redemptions, the Alchemist employs an earmarking system. Essentially, the system will reserve collateral and debt from user positions for future transmuter claims (time-based, continuous). Earmarked collateral cannot be withdrawn from the system. The only way to withdraw earmarked collateral is to repay earmarked debt with external MYT tokens. Separately, non-earmarked collateral/debt may be repaid and/or withdrawn at any time (subject to LTV requirements). \n\nThe MYT strategies are meant to be priced based off of fundamental oracles, ie the backing of each strategy. This is meant to avoid unfair liquidations due to flash crashes. Additionally, the MYT is never unwrapped or wrapped with the Alchemist - this is why transmuter positions recieve MYT tokens at time of redemption, not underlying.\n\nThe MYT strategies have a dual-unwrap approach through contracts and dexes. When a better outcome is gained through a dex (vs wrapping), a dex is used. For unwrapping, if the contract unwrap is unavailable (due to a queue), a dex is used. Thus, the MYT may be worth 1 ETH from the Alchemist point of view, even if the unwrap value at that exact instance is 0.99 (due to one of the strategies having a withdrawal queue). For this reason, long-tail risk strategies should not be used in the MYT.",

Reporting any of the below items are NOT IN SCOPE for this contest. All other bug findings in cantina would be valid reportings if still occurring:\n    - 3.1.8 - Devs did fix the calculation here but disagree that people putting money into the transmuter is a bad thing. They are technically adding backing to the system\n    - 3.2.2 - intended behavior \n    - 3.2.8 - UI handles this so intended behavior\n    - 3.2.15 - Incorrect. A user wouldnt be able to deposit into a new position twice in one block since they wouldnt know what the ID they were assigned until after the block is written.\n    - 3.2.21 - Intended behavior\n\n**Public Disclosure of Known Issues**\n\nBug reports for publicly disclosed bugs are not eligible for a reward. \n\n- Technically an individual could open numerous small positions at max LTV, hoping that they become eligible for liquidation so they can liquidate themselves and get paid from the feeVault for a net profit. However, the feeVault ONLY pays out when the alchemist is globally undercollateralized, NOT for liquidate individually undercollateralized positions when global collateralization is otherwise acceptable. This is an acceptable risk and therefore not considered in scope. None currently known\n\n**Private Known Issues Reward Policy**\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward.\n\n**Where might Security Researchers confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\n*Fundamental Oracles*\n\n- We are pricing strategies based on the fundamental backing, rather than dex price, whenever possible. This means there may be scenarios where the fundamental backing has a queue to access (such as the exit queue for wstETH). In these scenarios, as an example, 1 alETH in the transmuter would return 1 ETH worth of MYT, but that 1 ETH of MYT would not be accessible until the withdrawal queue clears, OR the user could sell the 1 ETH of MYT for < 1 ETH. Thus, the MYT market price may be < 1 ETH, which may bring the price of the alAsset < 1 ETH. This is intended behavior, as should the withdrawal queue clear the 1 ETH of MYT value would once again be instantly accessible and thus the alAsset would be redeemable for 1 ETH. \n\n- IF the price of the MYT drops below the LTV (say 1 ETH of MYT has a market price of 0.85 ETH) due to withdrawal queues, then it would be expected that arbitragers mint alETH to sell at > 100% LTV. However, so long as the value of the MYT these arbitragers collateralize returns to 1:1, there is no bad debt created in the system. Only a situation that returns permanent bad debt, even after MYT recovery, would be in scope (or a situation where the MYT is prevented from recovering). \n\n*Morpho V2 Vaults*\n\nThe Meta Yield Token is a Morpho v2 Vault. The base Morpho v2 code is unchanged and not in scope. Only the implementation of the base code and associated wrappers/extensions are in scope. (Ie, only issues that propogate from the main v2 code and implementation into the in-scope contracts are in scope). \n\n*Interfaces, Unit Tests, Mock Tokens*\n\nInterface Definitions, Unit Tests, and Mock Tokens are not in scope unless the issues propogate to the actual logic of the in-scope contracts. \n\n**Is this an upgrade of an existing system? If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nWhile some of the economic ideas of Alchemix V3 are closely tied to Alchemix v2, this is an entirely new codebase. The only carryover is that the alAssets that are currently minted by Alchemix v2 will be the same alAssets minted by Alchemix v3.\n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs and/or what attack vectors are you most concerned about?**\n\n*Flash Loans*: Alchemix v2 does not allow smart contract interactions, which means flash loans could never interact with Alchemix v2. Alchemix v3 does not have this restriction, thus attention paid to potential attacks that take significant capital (ie, flashloans) is appreciated.\n\n*Bad Debt and MYT Pricing*: Any attack vectors that would create permanent bad debt are very high priority, due to pricing exploits, pricing manipulation of internal oracles, or otherwise in the Meta Yield Tokens. The internal oracle especially should be a point of focus. \n\n*Liqudations*:  Liquidations are unique in that they need to interact with earmarking, as the system’s highest priority repayment is to fulfill transmuter obligations. This means if a position is eligible for liquidation, it will first have all earmarked debt cleared early, and then a liquidation will only occur if the redemption did not bring the user to a safe LTV. Thus, an invariant is that a liquidation shall never take priority over a redemption. The multistep liquidation system, with partial liquidations, is also somewhat custom and should be paid attention to.\n\n*0x Matcha Swaps*: Our ZeroXSwapVerifier (part of the dual unwrap/wrapping approach that uses both fundamental contracts and dex aggregation) heavily relies on implicit calldata parsing. We would like explicit effort put into the review that such in-place verification matches the 0x protocol logic and a malicious swap event cannot make it trough the strategy with manipulated tokens, senders, amounts, receivers, slippages etc\n\n*Earmarking*: Redemptions are discrete - when someone claims their transmuter position, their alAsset is burned and they recieve collateral directly from the Alchemist. Vault users will see both collateral and debt decrease. However, earmarking is continuous - essentially ensuring that building up to the time a transmuter position is claimed, enough collateral is being “reserved” in the system to ensure that users are unable to withdraw collateral that will be necessary to fulfill redemption obligations to the transmuter. This requires a continuous accounting weighting / earmarking system. Any inaccuracies in this system could be considered a valid bug. \n\n\n**What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported?**\n\nERC20 (throughout), ERC721 (transmuter, and enumerables used for alchemist NFT positions), ERC4626 (Meta Yield Token)\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement to be out of scope, as long as they operate within the privileges attributed to them?**\n\nNone (Ie, if trusted roles such as Alchemix DAO (Admin), 0xMatcha Aggregator, and Guardians are operating normally and a bug can occur, that would be in scope. Entering the wrong function inputs would NOT be in scope. Griefing would NOT be in scope.)\n\n**What addresses would you consider any bug report requiring their involvement be out of scope, even if they exceed the privileges attributed to them?**\n\n- Any Alchemix DAO multisig (Admin)\n- 0xMatcha Aggregator\n- Guardians\n\n(These are all trusted roles, however if there was a valid exploit that could be executed for example only when the 0xMatcha Aggregator is down or has a temporary loss of service, that would be in scope. Loss of functionality of the contracts while the aggregator is down would NOT be in scope unless it could result in permanent loss of user funds or bad debt. The aggregator just “being down” is not in scope, there would need to be impact beyond temporarily reduced protocol functionality)\n\n**Which chains and/or networks will the code in scope be deployed to?**\n- Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n- Morpho v2 Vaults\n- OpenZeppelin\n- Permit2\n- 0x Matcha Routing\n- Twap Pricing Mechanism\n- All yield strategies are dependent on the protocol they derive yield from\n\n**Are there any unusual points about your protocol that may confuse Security Researchers?**\n\n- The earmarking and redemption system is unique. The purpose of earmarking is to time-weight the communal redemptions in the system\n- The liquidation system is unique, especially in how it interacts with earmarking.\n\n**What are the most valuable educational resources already available? (Ie. Documentation, Explainer videos or articles, etc)**\n\n- https://keenanlukeom.github.io/alchemix-v3-docs/\n- https://keenanlukeom.github.io/alchemix-v3-docs/dev/alchemist/alchemist-contract\n\nResources related to: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/v3-poc/tree/immunefi_audit/src/strategies/mainnet\n- https://app.tokemak.xyz/pools/autoETH?breakdown=pools\n- https://app.euler.finance/vault/0xD8b27CF359b7D15710a5BE299AF6e7Bf904984C2?network=ethereum\n- https://app.morpho.org/ethereum/vault/0xE89371eAaAC6D46d4C3ED23453241987916224FC/yearn-og-weth\n- https://peapods.finance/lending/1/0x9a42e1bEA03154c758BeC4866ec5AD214D4F2191\n- https://app.euler.finance/vault/0xe0a80d35bB6618CBA260120b279d357978c42BCE?network=ethereum\n- https://peapods.finance/lending/1/0x3717e340140D30F3A077Dd21fAc39A86ACe873AA\n- https://app.tokemak.xyz/pools/autoUSD",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
