      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the  [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/) This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll Blockchain/DLT and Web/App bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Bug reports are required to include a runnable PoC in order to prove impact. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nHathor Labs requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters submitting a report and wanting a reward. The information needed is a government ID and proof of address.\n\nUnlike other bug bounty programs on Immunefi, all bug report submissions, including associated vulnerabilities, become the exclusive property of Hathor Labs. By making a submission to this program and in consideration for a bounty, the bug submitter conveys all ownership rights, titles, and interests in the bug report to Hathor Labs. Thus, the final decision on whether a postmortem will be written is at the sole discretion of Hathor Labs.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Hathor Labs__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __HTR__.\n",
