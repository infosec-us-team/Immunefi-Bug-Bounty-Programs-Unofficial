      "programOverview": "Toucan is building technology to finance climate action at scale. They are developing infrastructure to move carbon credits onto open blockchains, which helps make carbon markets more transparent, efficient, accessible, and scalable. \n\nToucans infrastructure is composed of four key modules:\n  1. The Carbon Bridge verifiably 1:1 tokenizes carbon credits from a supported registry and turns them into ERC-20 tokens that anyone can use. More than 20m carbon credits (or around 85 % of all on-chain carbon credits) have been tokenized using Toucans bridge\n  2. Their Carbon Pools are a way of grouping together tokens linked to credits with similar attributes. The result: standardized and deeply liquid carbon reference tokens (like NCT) that can be easily priced and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n  3. Information about all tokenized carbon credits is stored on Toucan's Open Carbon Registry. This is a unified global ledger with consistent data standards to be used across organizations. On the Open Carbon Registry, everyone can view the project information, trading history and retirement details of all tokenized carbon credits. The Open Carbon Registry brings much-needed transparency into a previously opaque market.\n  4. The retirement module helps companies retire carbon credits with the full transparency of a public blockchain.\n\nFor more information about Toucan, please visit [https://toucan.earth/](https://toucan.earth/).",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ and a maximum reward of __USD 200 000__.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n  - [https://byterocket.com/audit/toucan-protocol](https://byterocket.com/audit/toucan-protocol)\n  - [https://byterocket.com/audit/toucan-protocol-nct](https://byterocket.com/audit/toucan-protocol-nct)\n  - [https://byterocket.com/audit/toucan-protocol-retirement-certificates](https://byterocket.com/audit/toucan-protocol-retirement-certificates)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Toucan__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
