      "programOverview": "YoCash is an online gaming platform that utilizes blockchain technology to deliver a transparent, secure, and fair gaming experience. The platform currently hosts a variety of games, with results generated by Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF). This represents a substantial improvement over traditional online games, where outcomes could potentially be influenced by the operator or external actors.\n\nThe platform operates on EVM-based blockchains and accepts native coins or tokens for transactions.\n\nEach game on the platform has been designed with a low casino edge, ranging from 1% to 2%, with the exception of LuckyDraw, which stands at 10%. This modest fee is necessary for continuous development, maintenance, and to ensure sustainable profitability over time.\n\nThe goal of our project is to address the traditional challenges faced by players in the online gambling industry. We aim to do this by integrating the fairness, security, and transparency of blockchain technology into our platform.\n\nFor more information about YoCash, please visit [https://yoca.sh/ ](https://yoca.sh/) \n\nYoCash provides rewards in BUSD or USDT. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n__Responsible Publication__\n\nYoCash adheres to category 3. This Policy determines what information whitehats are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nYoCash adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts:\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Permanent freezing of funds\n- Smart Contract - Critical - Protocol insolvency\n- Smart Contract - High - Theft of unclaimed royalties\n- Smart Contract - High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed royalties\n- Smart Contract - High - Temporary freezing of funds\n- Websites and Applications - Critical - Execute arbitrary system commands\n- Websites and Applications - Critical - Retrieve sensitive data/files from a running server such as:\n   - /etc/shadow\n   - database passwords\n   - blockchain keys\n(this does not include non-sensitive environment variables, open source code, or usernames)\n- Websites and Applications - Critical - Taking down the application/website\n- Websites and Applications - Critical - Taking state-modifying authenticated actions (with or without blockchain state interaction) on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user, such as:\n   - Changing registration information\n   - Commenting\n   - Voting\n   - Making trades\n   - Withdrawals, etc.\n- Websites and Applications - Critical - Subdomain takeover with already-connected wallet interaction\n- Websites and Applications - Critical - Direct theft of user funds\n- Websites and Applications - Critical - Malicious interactions with an already-connected wallet such as:\n   - Modifying transaction arguments or parameters\n   - Substituting contract addresses\n   - Submitting malicious transactions\n- Websites and Applications - High - Injecting/modifying the static content on the target application without Javascript (Persistent) such as:\n   - HTML injection without Javascript\n   - Replacing existing text with arbitrary text\n   - Arbitrary file uploads, etc.\n- Websites and Applications - High - Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) without already-connected wallet interaction and with up to one click of user interaction, such as:\n   - Email or password of the victim, etc.\n- Websites and Applications - High - Subdomain takeover without already-connected wallet interaction\n- Websites and Applications - High - Injecting/modifying the static content on the target application without Javascript (Reflected) such as:\n   - Reflected HTML injection\n   - Loading external site data\n\nIf an impact is covered within the Primacy of Impact, it means that even if the impacted asset is not in-scope but is owned by the project, then it would be considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program. When submitting a report, just select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple projects, those other projects are not covered under the Primacy of Impact of this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nYoCash has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6427157117713-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge-), which is given to projects that adhere to our best practices. \n",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact the vulnerability could otherwise cause based on the Impacts in Scope table further below. \n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, only the first attack is considered if the smart contracts where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded, paused, or killed. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 201 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 402 blocks and then a third at 603 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 25% of the reward from the first attack, respectively.\n\n__Feasibility Limitations__\n\nBug reports that require an attack that involve one or more other protocols (e.g. utilizing flash loans from a margin protocol or manipulating the spot prices on a DEX), either to make an attack more severe than it would be in isolation, or to achieve an attack that would otherwise be impossible or infeasible, would be 50% of original payout amount. However, they will be considered as in-scope and categorized according to the program rules as long as all of the following are true:\n- Losses or other negative effects of the attack are inflicted upon YoCash ecosystem participants \n- The additional protocols used must have enough liquidity in various assets to allow the attack to succeed at the time of bug report submission. For example: if an attack requires an ETH flash loan, but the amount is larger than all the ETH available for loan across the ecosystem\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC is required for the following severity levels:\n- Smart Contract + Critical + PoC Required\n- Smart Contract + High + PoC Required\n- Website & Applications + Critical + PoC Required\n- Website & Applications + High + PoC Required\n\nAll PoCs submitted must comply with the Immunefi-wide [PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules) Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the YoCash team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in BUSD or USDT. \n",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "These impacts are out of scope for this bug bounty program. \n\n__All Categories__\n\n- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist) except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible\n- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code\n- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Feature requests\n- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program\n- The excessive reliance on automated tools and generating a significant amount of traffic adversely affects the availability and stability of production assets.\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain/DLT__\n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity impacts\n- Impacts from Sybil attacks\n- Impacts involving centralization risks\n- Best practice recommendations\n- Games outcome or funds temporarily frozen due to a call on contract by contracts admins during a running game, those will be compensated manually\n\n__Web/App__ \n\n- Theoretical impacts without any proof or demonstration\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring physical access to the victim device\n- Impacts involving attacks requiring access to the local network of the victim\n- Reflected plain text injection (e.g. url parameters, path, etc.)\n   - This does not exclude reflected HTML injection with or without JavaScript\n   - This does not exclude persistent plain text injection\n- Any impacts involving self-XSS\n- Captcha bypass using OCR without impact demonstration\n- CSRF with no state modifying security impact (e.g. logout CSRF)\n- Impacts related to missing HTTP Security Headers (such as X-FRAME-OPTIONS) or cookie security flags (such as “httponly”) without demonstration of impact\n- Server-side non-confidential information disclosure, such as IPs, server names, and most stack traces\n- Impacts causing only the enumeration or confirmation of the existence of users or tenants\n- Impacts caused by vulnerabilities requiring un-prompted, in-app user actions that are not part of the normal app workflows\n- Lack of SSL/TLS best practices\n- Impacts that only require DDoS\n- UX and UI impacts that do not materially disrupt use of the platform\n- Impacts primarily caused by browser/plugin defects\n- Leakage of non sensitive API keys (e.g. Etherscan, Infura, Alchemy, etc.)\n- Any vulnerability exploit requiring browser bugs for exploitation (e.g. CSP bypass) \n- SPF/DMARC misconfigured records\n- Missing HTTP Headers without demonstrated impact\n- Automated scanner reports without demonstrated impact\n- UI/UX best practice recommendations\n- Non-future-proof NFT rendering\n",
