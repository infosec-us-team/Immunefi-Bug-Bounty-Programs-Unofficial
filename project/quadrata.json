For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.\n\n__Known Issue Assurance__\n\nQuadrata commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Quadrata will either disclose known issues publicly or at the very least privately via a self-reported bug submission in order to allow for a more objective and streamlined mediation process to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report itself is valid, it would result in the bug report being considered in-scope and due 100% of the reward with respect to the bug bounty program terms.\n\n__Restrictions on Security Researcher Eligibility__\n\nSecurity researchers who fall under any of the following are ineligible for a reward\n- OFAC-sanctioned country or region\n- Does not pass Quadrata Identity Verification process (not able to mint a Quadrata Passport)\n\nKnown issues previously highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [Quantstamp](https://github.com/QuadrataNetwork/passport-contracts/blob/develop/audits/quantstamp-passport-final-2022-07.pdf)\n- [Certik](https://www.certik.com/projects/quadrata)\n",
