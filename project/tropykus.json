These lending protocols provide a decentralized marketplace for suppliers and borrowers holding crypto assets. \n\nTropykus provides alternative deposit and lending smart contracts for users with different interests in terms of return expectations and investment horizons, with similar risk management features of other lending protocols (e.g. collateralization, liquidation incentives). It also provides markets and accepts as collateral alternative crypto assets such as rBTC, RIF, rUSDT, DOC.\n\nThe main objective of Tropykus is to provide better financial services to everyday people in developing countries by creating a bridge between the needs of these users and the advantages of DeFi.\n\nFor more information about Tropykus, please visit [https://tropykus.com/](https://tropykus.com/). \n\nThis bug bounty program is focused on their smart contracts and is focused on preventing:\n\n  - Loss of user funds staked (principal) by freezing or theft\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds\n  - Smart contract gas drainage\n  - Block stuffing without fund transfers blocked\n  - Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn’t lose value\n  - Informational issues",

Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. All bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix to be considered for a reward. \n\nPayouts are handled by the __Tropykus__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
