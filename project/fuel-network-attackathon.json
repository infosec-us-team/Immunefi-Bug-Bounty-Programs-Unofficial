When these issues are fixed they will no longer be considerd known issues and the code will be brought back into scope to find bugs in the fixes. All intended fixes are included in the 'Known Issues' section.\n\n\nFuel Network’s codebase can be found here https://github.com/FuelLabs/ . Each asset in scope listed above is of a given hash which is the source of truth of what’s in scope.\n\nFuel Network will strive to have the Testnet match their Github assets. In cases where they differ, the links in the assets in-scope table will be the source-of-truth as to what’s in-scope. \n\n**Out of Scope Assets:**\n- Only the fuelvm target is in scope for the asset: https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/tree/7b56ec734d4a4fda550313d448f7f20dba818b59 . The evm and midenVM target are out of scope\n- Any smart contract with text stating that THIS CONTRACT IS DEPRECATED is out of scope.\n- FuelERC721Gateway contracts are also out of scope because they are pending development of a new version.\n\n**The Testnet deployment can be found here:**\n\n- FuelChainState - https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x404F391F96798B14C5e99BBB4a9C858da9Cf63b5 \n- Fuel Message Portal - https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x01855B78C1f8868DE70e84507ec735983bf262dA \n- FuelERC20GatewayV4 - https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xa97200022c7aDb1b15f0f61f374E3A0c90e2Efa0\n\n\n**Previous Audits & Public Disclosure of Known Issues**\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\nFuel Network’s completed audit reports can be found at https://github.com/FuelLabs/audits . Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n**Post Code Update Period Known Issues:**\n- P2P is doing a lot of database lookups - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2023\n- Sequential opcodes return an error when touching the last storage key - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2022\n- Unlimited spamming of TxPool - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2021\n- Transaction pool can be manipulated to do a lot of cleanups - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2020\n- The block production should take into account the available number of transactions - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2019\n- During block production should modify the block after passing all checks - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2018\n- Slow GraphQL request sender can drain resources of the node - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2017\n- WDCM and WQCM implementation mismatch with the specification - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/791\n\nThe following fixes will be deployed for the above known issues, at which point they'll no longer be known issues and will be brough back into scope to find bugs in again:\n- Optimize getting of transactions for blocks during network synchronization to decrease the load from p2p service.\n- Fix for the edge case for sequential opcodes to not return an error when the last key of operation is still in the range.\n- Handled the gas price and number of available transactions during the selection of the transaction in the TxPool.\n- Updated the executor's block production logic to modify the block only after transaction is valid.\n- Added increasing the base gas price based on the demand.\n- Optimize SMT updates within the transactions execution.\n- Fix 'WDCM' and `WQCM` to match the specification.\n\n**Miscellaneous issues:**\n\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/1361\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/6060\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-playground/issues/56\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5727\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/issues/1322\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/issues/2443\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/6091\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/issues/2492\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/6118\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-explorer/issues/366\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/418\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5892\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5124\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/15\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5886\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5049 \n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1961\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1966\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1967\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1049\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1968\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1969\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1970\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1971\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/764\n- https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/757\n\nThere may be other low severity findings tracked in these repos github issues which are not exhaustively listed here.

Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report.

Whitehats who focus here will earn the greatest rewards and acclaim from Fuel.\n\n**Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements**\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).\n\n**Feasibility Limitations**\n\nThe project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.",
