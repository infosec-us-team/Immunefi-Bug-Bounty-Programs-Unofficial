      "programOverview": "Ondo Finance brings exposure to US Treasuries and institutional-grade bonds on-chain, making it possible for stablecoin holders to earn yield through daily liquid, bankruptcy-remote, tokenized funds. Ondo significantly broadens the investor base that can capitalize on these yields, while reducing the friction experienced when converting between stablecoins and tokenized traditional assets.\n\nQualified purchasers receive tokenized fund interests which are transferable on-chain, including through approved smart contracts, paving the way for a compliant on-chain financial ecosystem powered by real world assets.\n\nFor more information about Ondo Finance, please visit https://ondo.finance/",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not sufficient as PoC; bug reports must include a runnable PoC in order to prove impact. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident, however  the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of possible economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. Regardless, there is a minimum reward of USD 25 000 for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports (including the issues highlighted in the Code4rena Competition READMEs and findings repos)  are considered out of scope: \n\n- [April 2024 Code4rena Audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2024-03-ondo-finance)\n- [April 2024 Cyfrin Audit](https://docs.ondo.finance/assets/files/Ondo-Cyfrin-Audit-April-2024-bee42209c337c75a895bfc262eee2e9a.pdf)\n- [September 2023 Code4rena Audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-09-ondo/)\n- [August 2023 Zokyo Audit](https://docs.ondo.finance/assets/files/Ondo-Zokyo-Audit-August-2023-45bb7b6e4758b278af6cbf69486e5824.pdf)\n- [April 2023 NetherMind Audit](https://docs.ondo.finance/assets/files/Ondo-NetherMind-Audit-April-2023-bc5dd8537fc4ad9f9314bc682cd49d76.pdf)\n- [January 2023 Code4rena Audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-ondo/)\n\n\nIn addition, the following known issues are also considered out of scope of this program:\n\n- Profiting from purchasing OUSG or USDY before a price increase and then immediately selling after. This includes using MEV and flash loans. \n- Effects from large price swings in the SHV ETF, which may constrain the prices at which OUSG can be set to\n- Effects from allowlists and blocklists (e.g. KYC Registry, USDC blacklist, Chainalysis Sanctions Oracle, USDY Blocklist, BUIDL Whitelist, etc.)\n- Effects from the BUIDL token being seized by the issuer or configured in a way that interferes with OUSGInstantManager Redemptions\n- Users unable to perform instant redemptions because there is not enough USDC or BUILD in the OUSGInstantManager contract\n- Users unable to perform instant redemptions because there is not enough USDC liquidity available for the BUIDL token\n- Effects from USDC depegging\n- Misuse of admin rights (malicious or accidental)\n- Taking advantage of rate limits to DDOS subscriptions and redemptions\n- Minimum redemption amounts prohibiting a user from performing a redemption\n- Minor imprecision stemming from rebasing tokens or differences in decimals. This includes intentional and unintentional dust accumulation in the form of token balances and rebasing token “shares.”\n- Front running permissioned setter functions that pertain to fees\n- Front running permissioned override functions for subscription or redemption state in OUSG Manager and USDY Manager\n\n\nPayouts are handled by the Ondo Finance team directly, are denominated in USD, and are processed in USDC.  The payment will be made by Ondo Finance Inc.",
