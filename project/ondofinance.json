      "programOverview": "Ondo Finance brings exposure to US Treasuries on-chain, making it possible for token holders to earn yield daily with highly  liquid, bankruptcy-remote, tokenized assets. Ondo significantly broadens the investor base that can capitalize on these yields and put their assets to work in blockchain-based applications, while reducing the friction experienced when converting between stablecoins and tokenized traditional assets.\n\nQualifying purchasers receive tokenized assets which are transferable on-chain, including through approved smart contracts, paving the way for a compliant on-chain financial ecosystem powered by real world assets.\n\nFor more information about Ondo Finance, please visit https://ondo.finance/\n\nOndo Finance provides rewards in USDC on Ethereum, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below.\n\n__KYC Requirement__ \n\nOndo Finance will be requesting KYC information in order to pay for successful bug submissions. The following information will be required:\n- Full name \n- Date of birth\n- Proof of address (either a redacted bank statement with address or a recent utility bill)\n- Copy of Passport or other Government issued ID\n\n__Eligibility Criteria__ \n\nSecurity researchers who wish to participate must adhere to the rules of engagement set forth in this program and cannot be:\n- On OFACs SDN list \n- Official contributor, both past or present\n- Employees and/or individuals closely associated with the project \n- Compensated team members of Ondo Finance or any of its affiliates;\n- Third-party vendors, suppliers and service providers to Ondo Finance or any of its affiliates, and team members of those third parties;\n- Businesses or organizations that are not Ondo Finance affiliates but hold or have held assets considered as critical infrastructure covered under the bug bounty program; third-party vendors, suppliers and service providers to those business or organizations; and team members of those business, organizations or third parties; and\n- Security auditors that directly or indirectly participated in the review of the code impacted, except for auditors that solely participated in crowdsourced/competitive audits sponsored by Ondo Finance.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nOndo Finance adheres to the Primacy of Impact for the following impacts, subject to the provisions of this section of Ondo’s Program:\n- Smart Contract - Critical\n\nPrimacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope. For more information, please see [Best Practices: Primacy of Impact](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n \nWhen submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\nIf the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.\n\nFor any impact that would be eligible for a reward based on the Primacy of Impact approach, but otherwise would not be eligible for a reward, the amount of the reward will be at Ondo Finance’s discretion. Rewards will not be provided for impacts that are out of scope, or where the limitations of this Program otherwise apply.\n\nAll other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.\n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with one or more Impacts in Scope on one or more Assets in Scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not sufficient as PoC; bug reports must include a runnable PoC in order to prove impact. Exceptions may be made, at Ondo Finance’s discretion, in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident; however, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time. In addition to these requirements, all PoCs submitted must demonstrate a good-faith effort to comply with the Immunefi-wide PoC Guidelines and Rules. Bug report submissions without a PoC when a PoC is required will not be provided with a reward.\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n- Profiting from purchasing OUSG or USDY before a price increase and then immediately selling after. This includes using MEV and flash loans. \n- Effects from large price swings in the SHV ETF, which may constrain the prices at which OUSG can be set to\n- Effects from allowlists or blocklists (e.g. KYC Registry, USDC blacklist, Chainalysis Sanctions Oracle, USDY Blocklist, BUIDL Whitelist, etc.)\n- Effects from the BUIDL token being seized by the issuer or configured in a way that interferes with OUSGInstantManager Redemptions\n- Users unable to perform instant redemptions because there is not enough USDC or BUIDL in the OUSGInstantManager contract\n- Users unable to perform instant redemptions because there is not enough USDC liquidity available for the BUIDL token\n- Effects from USDC depegging\n- Misuse of admin rights (malicious or accidental)\n- Taking advantage of rate limits to DDOS subscriptions, redemptions or bridges\n- Minimum redemption amounts prohibiting a user from performing a redemption\n- Minor imprecision stemming from rebasing tokens or differences in decimals. This includes intentional and unintentional dust accumulation in the form of token balances and rebasing token “shares.”\n- Front running permissioned setter functions that pertain to fees\n- Front running permissioned override functions for subscription or redemption state in OUSG Manager and USDY Manager\n- Bridge liveness impacts caused by the rate limiting configuration\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nOndo Finance’s completed audit reports can be found below. Any issues mentioned in the following reports, including but not limited to unfixed vulnerabilities,  are not eligible for a reward. For Code4rena Audits, findings in the competition READMEs and findings repositories are also not eligible for a reward. \n- [April 2024 Code4rena Audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2024-03-ondo-finance)\n- [April 2024 Cyfrin Audit](https://docs.ondo.finance/pdf/Ondo-Cyfrin-Audit-April-2024.pdf)\n- [September 2023 Code4rena Audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-09-ondo/)\n- [August 2023 Zokyo Audit](https://docs.ondo.finance/pdf/Ondo-Zokyo-Audit-August-2023.pdf)\n- [April 2023 NetherMind Audit](https://docs.ondo.finance/pdf/Ondo-NetherMind-Audit-April-2023.pdf)\n- [January 2023 Code4rena Audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-ondo/)\n\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Ondo Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).\n\n__Other Terms__\n\nThe Terms of Use between each participant in this bug bounty program and Immunefi Software Pte. Ltd., available at https://immunefi.com/terms-of-use/, shall apply between the participant and Ondo as if the participant were “you” or “User”, as if Ondo were “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”, and as if “Interface”, “Website” and “Platform” referred only to the portions thereof that are applicable to this bug bounty program (except for Sections 7, 8, 11, 23, the first two paragraphs of Section 1 and the first paragraph of Section 12).",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs, the reward amount is 10% of the funds directly affected up to a maximum of USD 1 000 000. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, a minimum reward of USD 50 000 is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks for smart contract bugs, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated within the first 45 minutes from the first attack, inclusive, no matter how many times the attack can be executed within that time frame, as demonstrated by the PoC provided by the security researcher.\n\nExample 1: vulnerability is discovered that can steal USD 1 million 30 times within 45 minutes from the first execution of the attack, then the funds at risk is considered as USD 30 million.\n\nExample 2: if a vulnerability is discovered that can steal USD 1 million once every 45 minutes from the first execution of the attack, then the funds at risk is considered as USD 1 million.\n\nHowever, for smart contracts directly holding funds that can’t be protected, if a discovered vulnerability includes the temporary locking of funds that could otherwise be withdrawn and thus prevented from being stolen but still accessible to the exploiter to take the funds, the time is extended to the exact same time as temporary locking. Extensions of the temporary locking that introduce a gap where withdrawals can happen will not be considered.\n\n__Reward Calculation for High Level Reports__\n\n- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are rewarded within a range of USD 11 000 to USD 50 000 depending on the funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward.  \n\n- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional [24h] that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lengthens, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\nPayouts are handled by the Ondo Finance team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC on Ethereum based on an implied USD:USDC exchange rate of 1:1.",
