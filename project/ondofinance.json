      "programOverview": "Ondo Finance brings US Treasuries and institutional-grade bonds on-chain, making it possible for stablecoin holders to invest through daily liquid, bankruptcy-remote, tokenized funds. Ondo significantly broadens the investor base that can capitalize on these yields, while reducing the friction experienced when converting between stablecoins and traditional assets.\n\nQualified investors receive tokenized fund interests which are transferable on-chain, including through approved smart contracts, paving the way for a compliant on-chain financial ecosystem powered by real world assets.\n\nFor more information about Ondo Finance, please visit [https://ondo.finance/](https://ondo.finance/)",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported. \n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. Bug reports are required to include a runnable PoC in order to prove impact. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists. However, the bug reporter may be required to provide a PoC at any point in time.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 25 000 for Critical smart contract bug reports.\n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope: \n- [https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-ondo/](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-ondo/)\n\nIn addition, the following known issues are also considered out of scope of this program:\n- Effects from blacklists (e.g. KYC revoked, USDC blacklist), if the effect only impacts the specific user.\n- Misuse of admin rights (e.g. malicious admin multi-sig)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Ondo Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__. The payment will be made by Ondo Finance Inc.",
      "outOfScopeAndRules": "The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:\n\n- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage\n- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials\n- Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)\n- Attacks that take advantage of rate limiting functionality within the CashManager\n- Attacks that take advantage of MEV to frontrun exchange rate updates\n\n__Smart Contracts and Blockchain__\n\n- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles\n   - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks\n- Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)\n- Lack of liquidity\n- Best practice critiques\n- Sybil attacks\n- Centralization risks\n\nThe following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:\n\n- Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets\n- Any testing with pricing oracles or third party smart contracts\n- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers\n- Any testing with third party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)\n- Any denial of service attacks\n- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic\n- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty\n",
