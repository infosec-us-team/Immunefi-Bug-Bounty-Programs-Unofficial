      "programOverview": "This bug bounty program includes in its scope actively used contracts as part of Sovryn’s Mynt and Zero smart contract systems and the accompanying frontend web application.\n\nZero is a decentralized borrowing protocol that enables users to lock BTC collateral in a “line of credit” and borrow a BTC-backed stablecoin called ZUSD at 0% interest, up to a minimum collateral ratio. ZUSD can then be deposited into a stability pool to provide liquidity for liquidations, or redeem ZUSD at face value for the underlying BTC collateral if the ZUSD peg drops too far below its expected value of 1 ZUSD = 1 USD. More information about Zero can be found [here](https://wiki.sovryn.com/en/sovryn-dapp/subprotocols/zero-zusd).\n\nMynt is a BTC-backed stablecoin aggregator. Users can deposit BTC-backed stablecoins such as DOC and ZUSD and receive a new stablecoin called the Sovryn Dollar (DLLR). At any time, the DLLR can be burned and redeemed for one of the underlying stablecoins. The purpose of aggregating BTC-backed stablecoins this way is to aggregate previously fragmented liquidity markets for the underlying stablecoins, and to create a new stablecoin that is more resilient and scalable than either of the individual underlying stablecoins.\nFor more information about Mynt and the Sovryn Dollar, please visit [https://wiki.sovryn.com/en/sovryn-dapp/sovryn-dollar ](https://wiki.sovryn.com/en/sovryn-dapp/sovryn-dollar)\n\n__For Whitehats:__ It is highly recommended that you review the details of this program in full. Although many Bug Bounty programs have standard terms and conditions, each also has their own unique details that are critical to your success.  \n\nPrior to submitting a report please review the [Immunefi Bug Report Template and Best Practices. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12435277406481-Bug-Report-Template)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are considered out-of-scope and ineligible for payout.",
      "rewardsBody": "Please review how rewards are distributed based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/) This is a simplified 5-level scale system with separate scales for Smart Contracts and Websites/Apps.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract bug reports will be further capped at __10%__ of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__.\n\nIn cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every __300 blocks__ the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at __600 blocks__ and then a third at __900 blocks__, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 25% from the first attack, respectively.\n\n__Payouts and Payout Requirements:__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Sovyrn team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in RBTC and SOV. The payment is made up of 50% in RBTC and 50% in SOV in a 24 month vesting contract. \n\nSovyrn commits to honoring payouts according to the terms set out in this program at the time of report submission, and to treat this program as the agreement and source of truth concerning bug reports and responsible disclosures. \n\nFor the purposes of determining report validity, this is a __Primacy of Impact__ program. \n\nLearn more about report validity best practices here: [Best Practice - Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules. ](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12340245635089-Best-Practices-Primacy-of-Impact)\n\n__KYC Requirements__\n\nZero and Mynt __does not__ have a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement for bug bounty payouts.\n\n__Audit Discoveries and Known Issues__\n\nBug reports covering previously-discovered bugs are not eligible for any reward through the bug bounty program. If a bug report covers a known issue, it may be rejected together with proof of the issue being known before escalation of the bug report via Immunefi. \n\nPrevious audits and known issues can be found at:\n- [https://github.com/DistributedCollective/sovryn-audits/blob/main/Smart%20Contract%20Audit_%20Zero.pdf ](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/sovryn-audits/blob/main/Smart%20Contract%20Audit_%20Zero.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProtocolandStabilityPoolFinalReport.pdf ](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProtocolandStabilityPoolFinalReport.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProxyContracts.pdf ](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProxyContracts.pdf)\n- [https://www.coinspect.com/liquity-audit/ ](https://www.coinspect.com/liquity-audit/)\n- [https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/Liquity.pdf ](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/Liquity.pdf)\n- [https://omniscia.io/sovryn-babelfish-protocol-v1/ ](https://omniscia.io/sovryn-babelfish-protocol-v1/)\n- __Issue with MocIntegration.sol when Fees are Introduced__\nThe function getDocFromDllrAndRedeemRBTC in MocIntegration.sol will always revert when fees are introduced for calling redeem (which is currently not the case) due to a require statement on line 86.\n\nrequire(\n            massetManager.redeemTo(address(doc), _dllrAmount, thisAddress) == _dllrAmount,\n            \"MocIntegration:: redeemed incorrect DoC amount\"\n        );\n\nOnce fees are introduced redeemTo would always return less than _dllrAmount.\n\n- __Missing Bridge Check in tokensReceived__\nThe function tokensReceived in MassetManager.sol lacks a check to ensure that it is called from the bridge. If an external entity relies on this event, it could result in an error, unexpected behaviour, or token loss.\n\n- __Two-Way Pointers Between Contracts Could Break__\nSome contracts have two-way pointers that may break due to errors made by programmers or deployers. Ideally, modifying one contract should also modify the other. Examples of such contracts include MassetManager <-> DLLR, and MassetManager <-> BasketManagerV3.\n\n- __mint Can be Called on MetaAssetToken__\nWhile transfer, transferFrom, and transferWithPermit have recipient checks in place, mint does not. As a result, it can be called with the MetaAssetToken contract as a recipient.\n\n- __Changing factor and bridge of a Basset Can Break Usage__ \nThere is currently no check to ensure that there are no massets issued for a basset before changing its factor or bridge, which could potentially result in a bad ratio between masset and basset. I suggest a require statement be added to these functions.\n\n- __Malicious Bridge Can Cause Griefing__ \nA malicious or compromised bridge for a specific basset could force a user to convert their massets into that basset using redeemByBridge in MassetManager, even if the user has no interest in the basset or does not trust the bridge or token. I recommend that a signature check be added to this function.\n\n- __Lack of Owner Check in upgradeToV3__ \nThe call to upgradeToV3 is in a separate transaction from deployment or initialization, and could potentially be front-run. There is currently no owner check in place for this function.",
