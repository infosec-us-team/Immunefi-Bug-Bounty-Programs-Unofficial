      "programOverview": "NFTfi is the leading liquidity protocol for NFTs. NFTfi allows NFT owners to use the assets (NFTs) they own to access the liquidity they need by receiving secured loans from liquidity providers, peer-to-peer, in a completely trustless manner.\n\nFor more information about NFTfi, please visit https://www.nftfi.com/ \n\nNFTfi provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n\n__Refinancing Feature Description__\n\nRefinancing is a feature that allows the borrower with an existing loan to refinance to a loan with better terms, using the same collateral. \n\nIt works by allowing the borrower with an existing loan to accept any other valid offer on the same collateral. The new offer is typically with a new lender, but could also be with the original lender.\nRefinancing between different types of loans\n\nThe contracts implementing the feature are one layer above the loan contracts and facillitates refinancing of loans between any of the loan contracts. You can refinance \n\n- a \"Direct loan\" to another \"Direct loan\"\n- a \"collection offer loan\" to another \"collection offer loan\"\n- a \"Direct loan\" to a \"collection offer loan\"\n- a \"collection offer loan\" to another \"Direct loan\"\n\n__Refinancing mechanism__\n\n- The refinancing contract takes over the borrowers loan position by taking ownership of the the Obligation Receipt (this requires the borrower to mint the O.R. and approve the Refinancing contract to transfer it)\n- The refinancing contract takes out a flashloan from DyDx and pays off the old loan\n- The refinancing contract initiates the new loan using the collateral NFT released from the old loan\n- Based on the relation of the old loan's principal and the new one's, the Refinancing contract either takes the deficit from the borrower or pays out a surplus (in the deficit-case, the borrower must approve the transfer of the erc20)\n- The refinancing contract pays off the flashloan\n- The refinancing contract transfers the borrower rights of the new loan by transferring the O.R to the borrower of the original loan\n\n__Limitations__\n\nRefinancing is only possible if the original and new loan have the same loan denomination.\n\nIf the currency of the source loan is not supported by DyDx (e.g. wstETH), we do a 2-way swap on uniswap at the beginning and the end of the process by swapping to WETH.\n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\nNFTfi adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\nA PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n\n__Previous Audits__\n\nNFTfi’s completed audit reports can be found at\n\n- First Refinancing audit - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hTW5eRUiklZg1_2Xo8zvYUSS-FHxD49r\n- Second Refinancing audit (with added functionality) -  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnmYjH-0OYP6Wbu9F5jMb19dD9Mf2ixu\n- Third Refinancing audit (with added functionality) - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HmKuN25_TYRWGAV9wn07OPK-sOYUKObg \n- Also relevant to this codebase: USDC blacklist vulnerability -  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vSJ86Ev51sJ56xtU5OZcZ_spgWidiacm\n\nAny unfixed vulnerabilities  mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, NFTfi has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209).",

      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\n__Reward Calculation for Critical Level Reports__\n\nFor critical smart contract bugs on testnet assets, the reward is paid as a flat amount of USD 20 000. This is because there are no actual funds at risk on the testnet, hence limits objective calculation. \n\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact.\n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the NFTfi team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
