Current implementations use a static IV or other, less accurate workarounds to price options. Lyra is also the first options AMM to compose with other DeFi projects to automatically price and hedge risk for LPs. The reduced risk allows LPs to feel comfortable to provide deeper liquidity, yielding more trading volume and higher fees.\n\nFor more information about Lyra, please visit [https://www.lyra.finance/](https://www.lyra.finance/).     \n",

This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nAll High and Critical Smart Contract bug reports require a PoC to be eligible for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of USD __50,000__.\n\nCritical payouts by Sherlock will only be paid out for critical bugs that would result in a loss of funds and can be executed profitably, and this then excludes Sherlock critical bounty payout for temporary freezing bugs.  If further clarification is needed to decide on a Sherlock payout, the [coverage agreement](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-reports/tree/main/coverage-agreements) between Lyra and Sherlock should be referenced. \n\nRe-entrancy attacks are only considered valid submissions if it is assumed that all plugged in smart contracts are the synthetix contracts\n\nAny attack vectors that require a custom quote/base asset (Lyra’s units of account - sUSD/sETH for example) are not eligible for a reward.\n\nAny vulnerability already disclosed in the [audits that have been performed](https://github.com/lyra-finance/lyra-protocol/tree/master/audits) are not able to receive a reward.\n\nIssues identified in previous audit reports may not be eligible for payout. \n\nTo be eligible for reward, impact from table below must be demonstrated where all thefts must be profitable and all freezing must be reasonably priced for the impact.\n\nPayouts up to USD __50,000__ are handled by the __Lyra__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDC__ or __ETH__, at the discretion of the team. Payments above that have the remainder paid out by __Sherlock__ with their bug bounty matching program and are done in __USDC__. ",
