This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required. All bug reports must also come with a suggestion for a fix in order to be considered for a reward. \n\nKnown issues highlighted in the following audits are considered out of scope of this program: \n  - [https://www.certik.com/projects/metalswap](https://www.certik.com/projects/metalswap)\n\nIn addition, any attempt to hack, gain access to, replace, modify, damage or impersonate the frontend or server services included in the architecture of the MetalSwap project are considered out of scope of the program. \n\nMetalSwap requires KYC to be done for all bug bounty hunters.  Metalswap requires a signed document (Confirmation of tax disclosure) to receive Rewards. The following information is required in this document:  Last Name, First Name, residential address, Country , Taxpayer Identification Number,and a ID/passport copy.\n\nPayouts are handled by the __MetalSwap__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __USDT__.  This bug bounty program will have a hard cap of USDT 50 000. In the event that multiple bug reports are submitted that exceed this amount, the rewards will be provided on a first come first served basis.",
