It consists of leveraging positions of the lending platform by repeatedly borrowing and supplying by looping over the assets.

If no valid bugs are found then the reward pool will be distributed between whitehats or returned to the project at Immunefi’s discretion. \n\nFor this Invite Only Program, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward. \n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/).\n\nRewards will be distributed all at once based on Immunefi’s distribution formula after the event has concluded and the final bug reports have been resolved.\n\n**Insight Rewards Payment Terms**\n\nInsight Rewards: Portion of the Rewards Pool\n\n* The \"Insight\" severity was introduced on Boost & Attackathon programs to recognize contributions that extend beyond identifying immediate vulnerabilities. Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report.
