Here's how they work:\n\n**Before the Attackathon**<br/> Immunefi works with the project to host a security-focused education period, providing top tier education and support to security researchers.\n\n**During the Attackathon**<br/> Security researchers experience optimal hunting conditions, with direct project support, responsiveness, and duplicate rewards.\n\n**After the Attackathon**<br/> Immunefi spotlights the security accomplishments with a custom leaderboard, Attackathon Summary Report, Bugfix Reviews, and Individual Achievement Cards.\n\nUltimately, Attackathons serve to secure projects, develop their security ecosystem, and create new opportunities for security researchers."

The more bugs a project fixes the more rewards will be unlocked for a simultaneously running **mitigation competition** with up to $100,000 USD in rewards that is open for everyone to participate in. Read our full [mainnet AC rules](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/33256328266769-Mainnet-Audit-Competition-Rules) for more info.\n\nBugs in code which is in scope for both the Aptos bug bounty program & Movement Attackathon will only be rewarded from the Movement Attackathon reward pool. This is so bugs won't be paid twice, once from Aptos bug bounty program and then again from Movement's Atttackathon. This only applies to bugs submitted while the Movement Attackathon is live.\n\n**Responsible Publication**\n\nImmunefi will publish bug reports, earnings, and a leaderboard for this Attackathon.\n\nSecurity Researchers may publish their bug reports as well, but only after Immunefi has published the valid bug reports as part of the competition results.\n\n**Dispute Resolution**\n\nIf there is any dispute over bug reports between projects and security researchers, Immunefi has final say on validity and severity based on the terms of this program.",

So if projects make more bug fixes mid-competition then the size of the mitigation competition reward pool increases up to the maximum.\n\nThe full mitigation competition reward terms can be [read here](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/33256328266769-Mainnet-Audit-Competition-Rules).",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
