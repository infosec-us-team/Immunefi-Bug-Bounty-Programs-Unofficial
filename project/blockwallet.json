All Medium and Low app bug reports require a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward. \n\nThe following vulnerabilities are not eligible for a reward:\n\n  - Any vulnerability that can only be abused by a local attacker\n  - Local Attackers (with access to the user’s machine/browser) are not part of our threat model.\n\nBug reports involving the ability to correctly determine the seed phrase will be paid at __USD 150 000__. All other extension bugs that are critical and result in loss of funds are paid at __USD 50 000__. High, Medium, and Low Web/App bug reports have the final reward determined by the BlockWallet team depending on exploitability, final impact, and ease of attack  \n\nPayouts are handled by the __BlockWallet__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
