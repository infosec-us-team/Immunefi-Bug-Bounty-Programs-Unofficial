These settings include changing the duration of “ONE_DAY” to 50 binance smart chain blocks (as opposed to 28800) and commenting out require statements in modifiers such as onlyGovernance in ImpossiblePair.sol and setRouter in ImpossibleFactory.sol. Specifically, we are aware that with these settings, if a router is not initialized upon contract deployment, an adversary can call setRouter and link a malicious router which takes advantage of how cheapSwap in ImpossiblePair.sol doesn’t perform K invariant checks. The scope of the bug bounty covers the “production version” of these contracts in which the 3 variables are uncommented instead of commented.*",

Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)",
