This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps and smart contracts/blockchains, encompassing everything from consequence of exploitation to privilege required to likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\nSmart Contract critical payouts have a maximum total payout of 10% of the funds that are directly potentially affected with a payout floor of USD 50 000. The estimated maximum payout is based on the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the Impossible Finance but is explicitly only an estimate and only the actual active amount at the time of reporting will be considered. The actual active amount of staked funds can be found on [https://farms.impossible.finance/farms](https://farms.impossible.finance/farms). \n\n__KYC__\n\nCountry of residence is required for KYC process\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Impossible Finance__ team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __BUSD__. For Critical payouts, up to 80% of the reward may be in the project token, __IF__.",

These settings include changing the duration of “ONE_DAY” to 50 binance smart chain blocks (as opposed to 28800) and commenting out require statements in modifiers such as onlyGovernance in ImpossiblePair.sol and setRouter in ImpossibleFactory.sol. Specifically, we are aware that with these settings, if a router is not initialized upon contract deployment, an adversary can call setRouter and link a malicious router which takes advantage of how cheapSwap in ImpossiblePair.sol doesn’t perform K invariant checks. The scope of the bug bounty covers the “production version” of these contracts in which the 3 variables are uncommented instead of commented.*",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of feasibility limitation standards which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n- [Chain Rollbacks](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913153448721-Chain-Rollbacks)\n- [Pre-Impact Bug Monitoring](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19430444320401-Pre-Impact-Bug-Monitoring)\n- [Attack Investment Amount](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17243068885265-Attack-Investment-Amount)\n- [Attacks With A Financial Risk To The Attacker](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17454897136401-Attacks-With-A-Financial-Risk-To-The-Attacker)\n- [When Is An Impactful Attack Downgraded To Griefing?](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17455102268305-When-Is-An-Impactful-Attack-Downgraded-To-Griefing)\n",
